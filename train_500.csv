"mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the rules package that we have before us today . it is outrageous that my republican colleagues have placed before us a rules package that at best lacks integrity , and at worst is completely unethical . as the highest body of elected officials in our country , we should be held to the highest ethical standards . but instead , my republican colleagues have opted to put before us a rules package that actually lowers our ethics standards , so that they may promote their own agenda , at whatever cost . this rules package makes it far more difficult for ethics investigations to take place . by requiring a majority of the ethics committee before an investigation can even begin , we are in great danger of diminishing the integrity of our great institution . with this new rule , the majority party can effectively block any ethics investigation of a member of their party . this is an abuse of power . and it 's not just democrats who oppose this plan . americans across the country have expressed their opposition to this plan . my democratic colleagues and i have a better plan that will strengthen the ethics rules to improve congressional accountability and to make sure that legislation is properly considered . the republican plan fails to close a loophole that allows legislation to be considered before members have read it . last year this led to the passage of a provision that would have let the federal government deeply invade citizens ' privacy by reading their tax returns . i am appalled that the republicans have failed to include the democratic provision to tighten this loophole . mr. speaker , i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on the resolution , so that we do not allow this rules package to become law .

"mr. speaker , i rise for a constitutional point of order . ",D
"mr. speaker , the resolution we are preparing to consider , the proposed rules for the 109th congress , in my judgment violates the united states constitution which we were just sworn to uphold and defend . it does so by allowing a very limited number of members , potentially only a handful , to constitute the house of representatives . article 1 , section 5 of the constitution states that `` each house shall be the judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its members , and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business ; but a small number adjourn from day to day , and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members. '' unfortunately , h. res. 5 seeks to allow a small number not just to adjourn or compel attendance , as the constitution stipulates , but to enact laws , declare war , impeach the president , and fulfill all other article i responsibilities . the very first act of the very first congress of the united states was to recess day after day after day because they lacked a quorum . just moments ago everyone in this body took an oath to uphold and defend the constitution , and now our first official vote is by rule to undermine a fundamental principle of that constitution , i.e. , what is a quorum . it is my understanding that the speaker is reluctant to judge on matters of constitutionality . i respect that . but i would reserve and inform the speaker it is my intent to ask the question of consideration to be put . ",D
"mr. speaker , consistent with the oath of office that i just took , i would request that the question of consideration be put to the body . ",D
"mr. speaker , on that i demand the yeas and nays . ",D
"mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of this balanced rules package . i want to speak particularly to the provisions regarding homeland security . to determine whether a proposed regime to oversee homeland security is appropriate , one can not just look at a flow chart . the simplest structure is not necessarily the best , nor is one that is unduly complex . one has to look at how a proposed structure will actually function and what it can and can not accomplish . the homeland jurisdiction being proposed in this package strikes the right balance between a system that is too centralized and one that is too diffuse . first , i should say that the most important and necessary change regarding governance of the department of homeland security was made 2 years ago when we created a subcommittee on homeland security on the committee on appropriations . but having a single committee that can look across the department of homeland security from an authorizing perspective is also a sensible move , and the new committee created in this package will do that . what would not make sense , however , simple as it might seem , is giving sole authority over all aspects of homeland security to the new committee . homeland security is too diffuse and important a government activity to rest with one committee . almost every activity of every federal agency has some relationship to homeland security , and almost every activity of the department of homeland security impinges on the activities of other agencies . an appropriate congressional oversight structure has to take account of that basic fact . a structure that overly centralized homeland security oversight would make it harder to evaluate the department of homeland security in the context of the other activities of the federal government . an overcentralized structure could also make a congressional committee a captive of the agency that it oversees . i know that it is very easy to denigrate arguments against a single , centralized select committee on homeland security as so much turf fighting . but in reality it is simply intellectually lazy to assume that a centralized structure would enable congress to do its work more effectively . i found especially ironic a washington post editorial that called for a highly centralized structure . the editorial argued that a centralized committee would be more efficient because the department of homeland security would not have to answer questions from a lot of different committees . well , it would also be more efficient if the department did not have to respond to questions from a lot of different news outlets , but presumably the post would argue that there are advantages to forcing the department to respond to reporters with a variety of areas of expertise and a variety of perspectives . the post certainly would not want the only news outlet to be an in-house publication . so i want to applaud the house leadership for doing what it has done , and i stand in strong support of this rules package . ",R
"mr. speaker , the chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct is correct when he says that ethics reform must be bipartisan and if the house is to have meaningful bipartisan ethics process , changes of this magnitude can be made , as they were in 1997 , only after thoughtful , careful consideration on a bipartisan basis . there has been no effort to look at the rules changes on ethics in a bipartisan manner . in 1997 when i co-chaired the committee on ethics reform along with bob livingston , the changes that we made were done after deliberation , and after democrats and republicans , working together , came before the house and we did make major changes . and we instituted the 45-day rule for assigning a proper complaint for investigation ; but we changed the rules in 1997 . we made it clear that you can move towards an informal investigation without a finding that it merits further inquiry or a resolution of preliminary inquiry because we did not want any matter of guilt or wrongdoing for the committee to be able to get the facts necessary to decide whether to go to formal investigation . yet this rules change which would allow after 45 days inaction to dismiss a complaint makes inaction action , and it can be done on a very partisan basis . now , that is wrong . that is not how it should be . the rules as they are currently configured in order to move a complaint past the committee , you have to have the bipartisan agreement of the committee because you have to have a vote in the committee . it guarantees a process will move forward in a bipartisan manner and , in fact , the committee on standards of official conduct has operated in a bipartisan manner because of the way the rules are configured . if this rule is changed , you are making it much more likely that the committee on standards of official conduct will act in a very partisan matter because they will be able to delay for 45 days , which does not take a lot of effort to figure out how to delay for 45 days . we have enough lawyers on the committee on standards of official conduct that will be able to figure out that one . and it will be done on a partisan basis that will leave a cloud on the member and a cloud on this institution . you should not have that in this rule . ",D
"mr. speaker , we are making a terrible mistake here today by changing the rule in terms of the provision that would simply require no action after a 45-day period because , as the earlier speaker immediately preceding me indicated , what we will have done is change a nonpartisan committee that is based on a nonpartisan process into one that provides for a partisan veto over action where the behavior of an individual member or members is at question . that , i suggest and submit , is something that this institution will suffer from . there has been much discussion recently regarding this package . it was anticipated that there would be additional provisions that were not submitted today , but let us be clear what is at risk here . it is the confidence of the american people in the integrity of this institution . perception , as we all know , is reality . and when the american people understand very clearly that we now have a committee on standards of official conduct in which either side has a veto , it will undermine the confidence of the people in our ethical process . my question to the proponents would be , what is wrong with the current rules ? we have operated on them . ",D
"mr. speaker , i offer a privileged resolution ( h. res. 5 ) and ask for its immediate consideration . ",R
"mr. speaker , for the purposes of debate only , i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. pelosi ) xz4003140 or her designee , pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume . during consideration of the resolution , all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only . mr. speaker , i rise in support of this rules package . i am also rising in support of the historic legislative agenda it will govern , for today marks the beginning of what historians will likely look back upon as the most productive and significant congress in decades . the mandate granted the majority , evidenced by our increased majorities in both houses of congress and the first presidential majority in 16 years , is clear . the american people have entrusted the state of their security , prosperity and families to us ; and over the course of the next 2 years , that sacred trust will be honored by action . we will continue to defend our homeland and prosecute the war on terror without retreat , and without excuses . we will provide our military , and their families , with the resources they need to do their heroic work on behalf of the nation they serve . we will hold rogue regimes accountable for their mischief , and hold fast to our friends around the world , from defiant democrats in israel and taiwan , to longstanding comrades-in-arms like the british and australians , to our resurgent allies in new europe . we will work with our ever-expanding coalition of the willing to secure the fledging democracies in afghanistan and iraq , and with every political , economic , diplomatic and military tool at our disposal , see the war on terror through to victory . domestically , our agenda will be no less audacious . we will continue the work begun in president bush 's first term to cultivate an opportunity society of economic choice and independence . we will continue to break down the walls , erected by 40 years of liberal policies , between the american people and their dreams . we will continue to provide seniors with access to affordable , quality health care while empowering them with unprecedented retirement security . we will continue to take on the three-headed monster of over-taxation , over-litigation and over-regulation that cuts the legs out from every sector of our economy . and while the 109th congress helps increase our national security and prosperity , we will also help american families raise their children in a society defined by the values that made our nation secure and prosperous in the first place . we will continue to better protect and educate our children , to protect the institution of marriage , to protect the constitution from judicial activism , and protect the role of family and faith in the public square . this rules package before us now will help us do this important work , work the american people have hired us to do . and yet , rather than laying out a positive vision for the next 2 years , or for that matter even discussing the substance of the rules package itself , some may choose this debate to launch the first of what i imagine will be countless personal attacks against the integrity of the majority and , ultimately , the integrity of this institution . it is a new year , mr. speaker , but an old game , and one to which we can not afford to stoop . too much is at stake ; too much depends on the success of this historic 109th congress . to my friends on the other side of the aisle , i would remind them all that i know what it means to be in the minority , to go into contentious votes certain of defeat , to always react to an agenda set by opponents . but i must also remind them that when republicans were in the minority , we engaged in the battle of ideas . we developed , and specifically proposed , a substantive vision for the future of our nation . in the 10 years since that vision was endorsed by our countrymen , we have been honored to work with all members of the minority on one issue or the other to develop successful legislative coalitions . with our close partisan margins and 24-hour media culture , we sometimes forget we are opponents , not enemies . we would all do well to remember that , especially given the stakes , the significance and , frankly , the sheer weight of the agenda before us . so i urge all members to support the rules package before us so we can immediately get to work on behalf of the men and women who sent us here . mr. speaker , i am honored to once again serve as leader ; but even with all of the gratitude i feel toward you , our conference and toward this body , the source of the honor i feel today is not all in this chamber . the source of the honor each of us rightfully feels today is our friends and families who have given us their love , the american people who have given us their trust , the men and women in uniform who put their lives on the line for us every day , and our heavenly creator who knitted us together in the womb . mr. speaker , may god bless the work and workers of the 109th congress , may god bless the cause of justice and freedom around the world , and may god continue to bless the united states of america . mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent that the balance of the time allocated to me be controlled by the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 . ",R
"mr. speaker , as has been the case for a number of years , the rules package put forward by my republican colleagues continues to trample on the rights of the minority . it will do nothing to stop the abusive practices in this house such as the 3-hour vote on the medicare bill in the middle of the night . in fact , it allows the speaker added discretion to reconsider votes that the republican majority loses . in addition , the new rules require an affirmative vote by the ethics committee before any action can be taken . this , in effect , gives my republican colleagues the right to block any investigation . i would like to focus on one portion of the package that will create a permanent committee on homeland security . while i am sure some of my colleagues believe that the new committee will improve our security , unfortunately this new committee will be nothing more than a costly addition to the expenditures of the legislative branch , and it will likely breed a new wave of `` turf warfare '' among the committees of the house . we simply do not need a special committee every time we face a crisis . the process under which we are being asked to approve this change is particularly troublesome . i call your attention to the last time the house felt compelled to create a new committee . in 1980 , some members of the house believed that it would be wise to create an energy committee . it used a careful process in which a committee on committees was created , consisting of democrats and republicans . when that committee reported its recommendations to the house , substitutes were permitted , and the result reflected a thoughtful understanding of how best to achieve the objectives . in contrast , we are now being asked to consider a proposal which was sent to us just yesterday . it was hatched in secret by our republican colleagues without the input of any democrats . while many of my democratic colleagues may agree with the need for a new committee , the right of the minority to have their views considered and voted upon has been trampled once again . i also oppose the notion that a new committee is needed . if the main concern is one of oversight , we can use our existing committees to do the job . if members still believed that a new committee was necessary , it need not have legislative jurisdiction . i am certain that is such a committee had legislative recommendations of merit , the appropriate committees along with proper actions by respective party leaders would ensure the bill would come to the floor . instead , i foresee a new committee that will seek to increase its powers by introducing bills granting all manner of new authorities to the department of homeland security . in addition , thoughtful bills addressing aspects of homeland security reported by the existing committees will now be delayed as the new committee will seek referrals . and needed responsiveness by the executive branch to the existing committees may be hindered . while the 9/11 commission urged a reorganization of congressional committees to deal with homeland security , it is odd that this new committee will have no jurisdiction over the issues that were identified by the commission that led to the 9/11 tragedy . the new committee will have no jurisdiction over the intelligence community , the law enforcement community , or immigration enforcement . it is a shame that the first day of this new congress should be marked by an attempt to authorize a new committee without so much as an open markup to consider its merits . moreover , it would be extremely unwise to ignore the expertise and experience of existing committees as we address homeland security issues , but we are starting down that path today . ",D
"mr. speaker , let me respond by saying that the gentleman is absolutely right when he states that the chair does not rule on questions of constitutionality . i would also like to say that on this question that is being brought forward by my friend , it is very clear to me based on statements that have been made by a wide range of constitutional scholars that what we are doing in the rules package that we are about to consider is in fact constitutional . in fact , before the committee on rules the very distinguished former solicitor general walter dellinger said the following : `` it is simply inconceivable that a constitution established to provide for the common defense and promote the general welfare would leave the nation unable to act in precisely the moment of greatest peril . no constitutional amendment is required to enact the proposed rule change because the constitution as drafted permits the congress to ensure the preservation of government. '' let me further , mr. speaker , say that the committee on rules intends to conduct further examination of the best way for the house to assure a continuity of government during a national emergency , and it is our hope that as we proceed with this work that further discussions will take place with the members of that very distinguished panel , the continuity commission , which included our former colleague , senator simpson , and speakers foley and gingrich and former minority leader bob michel , leon panetta , kwasi mfume , and i believe we will have a chance to proceed with this ; but i think it would be very appropriate for us to proceed with consideration of the rules package that we have . ",R
"mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from texas ( mr. delay ) xz4001040 for his fine statement and for yielding me the time to discuss this opening-day rules package . mr. speaker , the house is an institution built upon its rules . accordingly , it is very appropriate that one of the first orders of business for this 109th congress will be to adopt a rules package which is both true to the traditions and very forward thinking in its outlook for the work of this congress that lies ahead . the package we have before us represents the work product of many members . during the initial stages of compiling this rules package back in november , the committee on rules received 40 different proposals from both democrats and republicans . in addition to that , our committee staff has actively sought the input of the officers of the house , its committees and its caucuses to get their perspectives on the kinds of changes we can make to facilitate the work of the house . all of the ideas contained in this resolution reflect the considered judgment of our colleagues and will ultimately improve our ability to carry out our constitutional responsibilities . mr. speaker , i include for the record at this point detail on each of these changes in a section-by-section analysis . section-by-section summary of h. res. 5 , adopting house rules for the 109th congress the rules of the house of representatives for the 108th congress are adopted as the rules of the house for the 99th congress with amendments as provided in section 2 and with other orders as provided in section 3. ( a ) committee on homeland security . creates a standing committee on homeland security , and grants it legislative and oversight jurisdiction . first , the committee 's jurisdiction includes overall homeland security policy so that it can focus on national policies affecting the federal government . second , the jurisdiction includes authority over the department of homeland security ( dhs ) 's internal administration . third , the committee would have jurisdiction over functions of the dhs relating to six specified areas . these include : ( a ) border and port security ( except immigration policy and non-border enforcement ) ; ( b ) customs ( except customs revenue ) ; ( c ) integration , analysis and dissemination of homeland security information ; ( d ) domestic preparedness for and collective response to terrorism ; ( e ) research and development ; and ( f ) transportation security . additionally , the committee would have broad oversight authority over government-wide homeland security matters . finally , changes are made to the ( b ) general oversight responsibilities -- insuring against duplicative programs . adds to the required list of content included in each standing committee 's adopted oversight plan as submitted to the committees on government reform and house administration a review of federal programs with a view to insuring against duplication of such programs . [ rule x , clause 2 ( d ) ( 1 ) ] ( c ) ( 1 ) membership of budget committee . permits one member of the budget committee majority and one member of the minority to be `` designated '' by the respective elected leaderships . current rules require such members to be `` from '' elected leadership . [ rule x , clause 5 ( a ) ( 2 ) ] ( c ) ( 2 ) rules committee organization . authorizes the chairman of the committee on rules to serve as chairman , notwithstanding the prohibition on serving more than three consecutive terms . [ rule x , clause 5 ( c ) ( 2 ) ] ( d ) ( 1 ) privileged motions in committee -- recess subject to the call of the chair . allows for a privileged motion in committee to recess subject to the call of the chair for a period less than 24 hours . currently only a motion to recess from day to day is privileged . [ rule xi , clause 1 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( b ) ] ( d ) ( 2 ) motion to go to conference . allows committees to adopt a rule directing the chairman of the committee to offer a privileged motion to go to conference at any time the chairman deems it appropriate during a congress . currently a motion to request or agree to a conference with the senate is privileged if the committee authorizes the chairman to make such a motion . [ rule xi , clause 2 ( a ) ] ( e ) motion to suspend the rules . extends suspension authority beyond monday or tuesday to include wednesday . [ rule xv , clause 1 ( a ) ] ( f ) repeal of corrections calendar . removes corrections calendar from the standing rules of the house . [ rule xv , clause 6 ] ( g ) allows references to the senate . allows remarks in debate to include references to the senate or its members . remarks are to be confined to the question under debate , avoiding personality . [ rule xvii , clause 1 ] ( h ) provisional quorum . provides for continuity of legislative operations in the house in the event of catastrophic circumstances . the rule allows for the house to conduct business with a provisional quorum only after a motion to compel members attendance , as prescribed under clause 5 ( a ) of rule xx , has been disposed of and the following occur in sequence without the house adjourning : ( a ) a call of the house or a series of calls of the house totaling 72 hours without producing a quorum ; ( b ) the speaker , with the minority and majority leaders , receive from the sergeant-at-arms ( or his designee ) a catastrophic quorum failure report and shall consult with the minority and majority leaders on the contents of such report and shall announce the contents of such report to the house ; and ( c ) a further call of the house or series of calls are conducted for a total of 24 hours without producing a quorum . a catastrophic quorum failure report is defined as a report advising that the inability of the house to establish a quorum is attributable to catastrophic circumstances involving natural disaster , attack , contagion , or similar calamity rendering ( i ) postponement of certain votes . adds the motion to reconsider , tabling motions to reconsider and amendments reported from the committee of the whole among those votes the speaker may postpone to a designated place in the legislative schedule within two additional legislative days . [ rule xx , clause ( a ) ( 2 ) ] ( j ) ( 1 ) - ( 2 ) allowing the use of campaign funds to pay for certain official expenses . allows members to use campaign funds to pay certain , limited types of official expenses ( e.g. , handheld communication devices ) . this change conforms house rules to current law ( sec . 105 , p.l . 108-83 ) , and mirrors rules that took effect in the senate in 2002 . [ rule xxiv and rule xxiii , clause 6 ( c ) ] ( j ) ( 3 ) use of frank for mass mailings before an election . amends the rule to conform to section 3210 of title 39 united states code , stating that a mass mailing is not frankable when it is postmarked less than 90 days before the date of a primary or general election which he is a candidate for public office . currently the rules states 60 days . [ rule xxiv , clause 8 ] ( j ) ( 4 ) gift rule on officially connected travel . expands the category of individuals who may accompany a member or staff person on such a trip at the sponsor 's expense to include a relative of the member or the staff person . under a provision of the current gift rule ( clause 5 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( d ) of the house rule xxv ) , a member or staff person may be accompanied on a privately funded , officially connected trip , at the sponsor 's expense , only by either his or her `` spouse or a child '' , and not by any other relative . [ rule xxv , clause 5 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( d ) ] ( k ) ( 1 ) due process for members . affords members the opportunity to be heard in the event the standards committee alleges the member has violated or may have violated the code of conduct . members may opt for either an adjudicatory proceeding or they can submit a response to the committee report/letter with their response being made public with committee report/letter . under the current rule , the chairman and ranking member , or the committee , may take action against a member without a complaint , notice , or the opportunity to be heard . [ rule xi , clause 3 ] ( k ) ( 2 ) restore presumption of innocence . provides that no action will be taken on a complaint unless the chairman and ranking minority member of the standards committee , or the committee itself , find within 45 days that further investigation is merited by the facts of the complaint , maintaining the presumption of innocence . currently , if the chairman and ranking minority member take no action on a properly filed complaint within 45 days , the matter automatically goes to an investigative committee . ( k ) ( 3 ) right to counsel . provides that members may select a counsel of their choice even if that counsel represents other members . [ rule xi , clause 3 ] ( 1 ) technical and codifying changes . technical and grammatical changes are made throughout the rules of the house . ( a ) ( 1 ) - ( a ) ( 3 ) continuation of budget enforcement mechanisms from the 108th . clarifies that section 306 of the budget act ( prohibiting consideration of legislation within the budget committee 's jurisdiction , unless reported by the budget committee ) only applies to bills and joint resolutions and not to simple or concurrent resolutions . it also makes a section 303 point of order ( requiring adoption of budget resolution before consideration of budget-related legislation ) applicable to text made in order as an original bill by a special rule . specified or minimum levels of compensation for federal office will not be considered as providing new entitlement authority . ( a ) ( 4 ) continuation of budget `` deeming '' resolution from the 2nd session of the 108th congress . establishes that the provisions of the senate concurrent resolution 95 of the 108th congress , shall have effect in the 109th congress until such time as a budget resolution for the fiscal year 2005 is adopted . ( b ) extra subcommittees for armed services , international relations , and transportation & amp ; infrastructure . a waiver of rule x , clause 5 ( d ) , is granted for armed services and transportation & amp ; infrastructure for 6 subcommittees , and international relations for 7 subcommittees in the 109th congress . ( c ) numbering of bills . in the 109th congress , the first 10 numbers for bills ( h.r. 1 through h.r. 10 ) shall be reserved for assignment by the speaker to such bills as he may designate when introduced . the gentlewoman from virginia ( mrs. jo ann davis ) xz4000950 is the author of one important provision directing committees to review matters within their jurisdiction to ferret out duplicative government programs as part of their oversight planning at the beginning of each congress . we are also making the ability to consider suspensions on wednesdays permanent in this congress after the very successful experiment we had with suspensions on wednesday in the 108th congress . the package includes important provisions to allow us to function in situations where large numbers of members are incapacitated . we discussed that earlier , mr. speaker . the provisional quorum language includes a number of safeguards to ensure that this institution can continue to operate during times of turmoil and to ensure that democracy will be preserved . we are living in a post-9/11 world and it is very important that we continue to expend a lot of time and energy dealing with the institutional challenges as well as the challenges that our nation faces under these circumstances . i would like to say , also , mr. speaker , that we will eliminate the corrections calendar . this was originally intended to make it easier to consider legislation making corrections to outright errors that are in law but it turned out to after a while become more cumbersome than other procedures that we already have to deal with that , such as the suspension calendar . and , yes , mr. speaker , in a change guaranteed to draw applause from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle , the house rules will now allow us to make reference to the senate and its members , so long as those references are confined to the question under debate and that they avoid personality . the senate has long had a similar provision and this new rule merely conforms our rules to theirs . i know that my colleagues and i share the desire to maintain our traditions of dignity and decorum in proceedings , and i believe that we can do that even with the rules change that i have just discussed . on another topic , the package makes a series of changes to our ethics rules . we included two provisions suggested by the chairman and the ranking member of the committee on standards of official conduct , number one , clarifying the rule on officially connected travel to allow a family member other than a spouse or child to travel with the member at the sponsor 's expense and , two , conforming the rules of the house to current law which allow the use of campaign funds to pay for certain official expenses , such as cell phones . by the way , we also have included a provision suggested by the distinguished gentleman from connecticut ( mr. larson ) xz4002330 to conform the rules of the house to current law with regard to the 90-day preelection limit on franked mail . the package also includes two other provisions addressing our ethics rules . the first gives members the same rights to choose their counsel before the ethics committee that they would enjoy if they were a respondent in a court case . the second change addresses an inequity in the standards committee process requiring an investigative subcommittee if the chairman and ranking member do not act within 45 days . this change restores the presumption of innocence in our process . let me say that we are going to be hearing from the distinguished chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct in just a few minutes , mr. speaker . as important as each of those changes are , perhaps the most important change in this resolution will be , as the speaker said in his very thoughtful opening statement here today , the creation of a new standing committee on homeland security . it represents a far-reaching and critically important part of our overall strategic effort to protect the american people . the 9/11 commission unanimously called for this action . they saw the need , and we believe most members do as well . over the past 3 years , the congress has asked the american people to accept change in countless ways . we have mandated change at the federal , state and local levels . we have asked for change from our allies and forced change upon our enemies . and we saw the need for change over 2 years ago , and we responded here , first with the enactment of the homeland security act of 2002 and then with the formation of the select committee on homeland security . their final report , a thorough and complete study of homeland security jurisdiction as it relates to house rules , was transmitted to the committee on rules at the end of last year . this change in house rule x , which governs the committees and their legislative jurisdictions , is a delicately crafted architecture . it creates with this jurisdiction and the legislative history that i will be placing in the record , the department of homeland security will have more certainty as to which committee has the primary responsibility for homeland security . at the same time , the american people will live with the assurance that we are working to prevent anything from falling through the cracks . mr. speaker , the new committee will have jurisdiction over , first , overall homeland security policy ; second , the organization and administration of the department of homeland security ; and , third , functions of the department of homeland security relating to border and port security , except immigration policy and nonborder enforcement ; customs , except customs revenue ; the integration , analysis and dissemination of homeland security information , domestic preparedness for , and collective response to , terrorism , research and development , and transportation security as well . by approving this resolution , mr. speaker , the house will do what the speaker and the 9/11 commission as well as the president has asked us to do , consolidate jurisdiction of the house into one committee . this committee will be dedicated to setting national homeland security policy and to effectively overseeing that the department of homeland security carries out its mission . finally , mr. speaker , as we discuss this resolution , i will look forward to questions from my colleagues about jurisdictional matters , but i will say that clearly the issue of referral lies solely in the hands of the speaker . i will in no way be responding in a manner which would infringe on that power of the speaker . once again i want to say on all of these issues , and especially the last one , which was a great challenge in trying to fashion a new committee on homeland security with jurisdiction that emerged from many other committees was not an easy task . i want to congratulate speaker hastert for the leadership that he has shown on this and i want to thank all of the committee chairmen who were involved in this process . i believe that with the passage of this house rules package , we will be able to create a stronger and a safer america , which is a priority for every single one of us who has taken the oath of office today . i urge support of this package of rules . mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .

"mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . i just want to say to the gentlewoman from rochester , new york ( ms. slaughter ) xz4003780 that every single member of this institution , democrat and republican alike , is very concerned and focused on the integrity of this institution ; and i believe that that is something which is an extraordinarily high priority for all of us . i believe that the package that we have coming before us is one which addresses many of the concerns that frankly were raised by the gentlewoman from new york ( ms. slaughter ) xz4003780 . mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the very distinguished gentleman from miami , florida ( mr. lincoln diaz-balart ) xz4001070 , my colleague on the committee on rules .

"mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . i would like to respond to my very good friend from maryland by saying that i may not be as eloquent today as i was when i was in the minority , but i continue to share my very strong commitment to ensure the integrity and the behavior of members of this institution . i also will say as my friend said , it is very clear that the gentleman from colorado ( mr. hefley ) xz4001740 , chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct , has made it clear that he is supportive of this package . i and my colleagues looked at these recommendations , all of which emerged from members and former members of the committee on standards of official conduct . i also believe that it is very possible for us to maintain the highest ethical standards and to continue to ensure , to now ensure that due process is entitled to members of this institution as they proceed with matters before that committee . so i believe that this package is one which should enjoy strong bipartisan support , because when it comes to matters of ethics it will address the concern and the protection of members of both the minority and the majority , as well as this institution as a whole . mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .

"mr. speaker , i will be happy to respond to the gentleman . let me say we are in the midst of a discussion about ethics at this point . obviously , it is our goal to maintain the highest ethical standards . we have a law , which is actually a criminal law , which states that it is a violation of 18 u.s. code 607 for the solicitation of campaign contributions from federal property . the idea behind this change that is included in this rules package is that members should not be required to carry two separate cell phones with them . this would allow campaign funds to be used for the purchase of a cell phone that might be used for calling your office or other official purposes . but the law which prevents the solicitation of campaign contributions from federal property in fact is maintained and is one we that feel very strongly about .

"mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . mr. speaker , we have a great rules package that is coming before us , a rules package which i believe is deserving of bipartisan support . the reason i say it is deserving of bipartisan support is that is the word that has been used by members on both sides of the aisle to describe exactly what we have been doing here and should be doing here . mr. speaker , this package includes a number of very important provisions . it allows us to deal with the prospect of a horrendous attack on this institution , and it allows us to continue this institution 's operations so the american people will understand that this institution stands even at a time of great crisis . this rules package allows for the establishment of a new permanent standing committee on homeland security , as the speaker outlined in his opening remarks here today . i believe that is something that will allow democrats and republicans to spend time working on that issue . mr. speaker , this is a rules package which allows for bipartisan process at the ethics committee level . the committee on standards of official conduct is the committee which has the responsibility of working to ensure the integrity of all of the members of this institution . the package we have before us does just that . i believe that the statement made by the chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct , the gentleman from colorado ( mr. hefley ) xz4001740 , is very clear . he understands that the provisions included in this package will in fact maintain the integrity of this institution . he was not going to support the earlier package ; he is supporting this package . the issue of bipartisanship is important because in this package we ensure that we will not see the politicization of the ethics process which tragically we have seen in the past , because it will require bipartisanship , which all members are talking about , if we do proceed with the investigatory process . that is the right thing to do , and i believe this package should in fact enjoy the support of democrats and republicans alike because it is designed to protect this institution and its members . mr. speaker , the house is an institution built upon its rules . accordingly , it is appropriate that one of the first orders of business of the 109th congress will be to adopt a rules package which is both true to its traditions and forward-thinking in its outlook . the package we have before us represents the work product of many members . during the initial stages of compiling this package , back in november , the rules committee received 40 difference proposals form both democrats and republicans . in addition , our committee staff has actively sought the input of the officers of the house , its committees , and its caucuses to get their perspectives on the kinds of changes we can make to facilitate the work of the house . while not every proposal we received was incorporated into this package , i assure you that each received substantial consideration by the speaker and the rules committee . and , as always , the rules committee will continue to review our rules and operations to see where other improvements can be made . mr. speaker , all of the ideals contained in this resolution reflect the considered judgment of our colleagues , and will ultimately improve our ability to carry out our constitutional responsibilities . while i will detail each of these changes in the section-by-section that i will place in the record , i want to elaborate on just a few of these changes . the gentlewoman from virginia ( mrs. jo ann davis ) is the author of one important provision directing committees to review matters within their jurisdiction to ferret out duplicative government programs as part of their oversight planning at the beginning of each congress . there are a number of instances where we are conforming the rules to reflect current house practice , such as with the designation of leadership members of the budget committee and the taking of recesses in committee to allow flexibility on our schedules . we are also making the ability to consider suspensions on wednesdays permanent in this congress after our successful experiment in the 108th congress . the package includes important provisions to allow us to function in situations where large numbers of members are incapacitated . the `` provisional quorum '' language includes a number of safeguards to ensure that this institution can continue to operate during times of turmoil and democracy will be preserved . as we search for permanent solutions to the problems facing us in the post-9/11 era , this is an important step in meeting our responsibilities . we will also eliminate the corrections calendar . while this was originally intended to make it easier to consider legislation making corrections to outright errors in law , it turned out to be more cumbersome than other procedures , such as consideration under suspension of the rules . and yes , mr. speaker , in a change guaranteed to draw applause from my colleagues , the house rules will now allow us to make reference to the senate and its members , so long as those references are confined to the question under debate and avoid personality . the senate has long had similar provisions and this new rule merely conforms our rules to theirs . i know that my colleagues and i share the desire to maintain our traditions of dignity and decorum in proceedings , and will do so even with this rules change . on another topic , the package makes a series of changes to our ethics rules . we included two provisions suggested by the chairman and ranking member of the standards committee : ( 1 ) clarifying the rule on officially connected travel to allow a family member other than a spouse or child to travel with the member at the sponsor 's expense , and ( 2 ) conforming the rules of the house to current law which allow the use of campaign funds to pay for certain official expenses , such as a cellphone . we also included provision suggested by the gentleman from connecticut ( mr. larson ) to conform the rules of the house to current law with regard to the 90-day pre-election limit on franked mail . the package also includes two other provisions addressing our ethics rules . the first gives members the same rights to choose their counsel before the ethics committee that they would enjoy if they were a respondent in a court case . the second change addresses an inequity in the standards committee process requiring an investigative subcommittee if the chairman and ranking member do n't act within 45 days . this change restores the presumption of innocence in our process . as important as each of those changes are , mr. speaker , perhaps the most important change in this resolution will be the creation of a new standing committee on homeland security . it represents a far-reaching and critically important part of our overall strategic effort to protect the american people . the 9/11 commission unanimously called for this action . they saw the need , and we believe most members do , too . over the past 3 years , the congress has asked the american people to accept change in countless ways . we have mandated change at the federal , state , and local levels . we have asked for change from our allies and forced change upon our enemies . and we saw the need for change over 2 years ago , and we responded , first with the enactment of the homeland security act of 2002 , and then with the formation of the select committee on homeland security . their final report , a thorough and complete study of homeland security jurisdiction as it relates to house rules , was transmitted to my committee at the end of last year . these measures made it clear to me and many other members that steps need to be taken to further ensure the safety of the american people . the rules committee thoroughly reviewed the select committee 's report and recommended a comprehensive and thoughtful reform effort that mirrors the recommendations of the 9/11 commission : the formation of a permanent committee on homeland security . this change in house rule x , which governs the committee and their legislative jurisdictions , is delicately crafted architecture . it draws to the new committee only jurisdiction directly related to our defense against terrorism . thus , it creates a primary committee while recognizing the other legitimate oversight roles of existing committees . it acknowledges the expertise and experience residing in other committees and leaves with them jurisdiction that may have a homeland security implication but not a direct policy relationship . the house must have one central point where we , as national legislators , sort out the critical questions of securing our homeland without sacrificing our free society or a stable economy . however , we envision a system of `` purposeful redundancy. '' by that we mean more than one level of oversight and an atmosphere in which the competition of ideas is encouraged . with this jurisdiction and the legislative history that i will place in the record , the department of homeland security will have more certainty as to which committee has the primary responsibility for homeland security . at the same time , the american people will live with the assurance that we are working to prevent anything from falling through the cracks . mr. speaker , the new committee will have jurisdiction over : ( 1 ) overall homeland security policy ; ( 2 ) the organization and administration of the department of homeland security ; and ( 3 ) functions of the department of homeland security relating to border and port security ( except immigration policy and non-border enforcement ) , customs ( except customs revenue ) , the integration , analysis , and dissemination of homeland security information , domestic preparedness for and collective response to terrorism , research and development , and transportation security . by approving this resolution , the house will do what the speaker and the 9/11 commission has asked it to do : consolidate jurisdiction of the house in one committee . this committee will be dedicated to setting national homeland security policy and to effectively overseeing that the department of homeland security carries out its mission . mr. speaker , in making these changes , i want to note several points for the record . first , referrals to the select committee on homeland security in the 108th congress will not be considered a precedent for referrals in the 109th congress . second , at the request of mr. thomas , i am placing a document into the record regarding understandings between the department of treasury and the department of homeland security . third , because the department continues to evolve , references to a department , agency , bureau , office , or subdivision include a reference to successor entities to the extent that the successor engages in homeland security activities now conducted by the department , agency , bureau , office , or subdivision referred to in the legislative history . for example , the homeland security act of 2002 transferred the office of domestic preparedness to the department of homeland security , to `` have the primary responsibility within the executive branch of government for preparedness of the u.s. for acts of terrorism. '' subsequently , its name has been changed by the department to `` office of state and local government coordination and preparedness ( slgcp ) '' although its mission stays the same . finally , i welcome questions from my colleagues about jurisdictional matters related to this change . however , i want to caution all members that referrals are solely within the speaker 's power , and , in my answers , i will not infringe upon the power . once again , i appreciate the input from all of you regarding the 109th rules package , and i feel that with your assistance , we will make the rules of the house stronger and make for a safer country .

"mr. speaker , i am inserting for the record the following legislative history regarding the changes made by this resolution to rule x , along with supporting materials . legislative history to accompany changes to rule x rule x and the committee on homeland security & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; legislative history overall homeland security policy -- the jurisdiction of the committee on homeland security over `` overall homeland security policy '' is to be interpreted on a government-wide or multi-agency basis similar to the committee on government reform 's jurisdiction over `` overall economy , efficiency , and management of government operations and activities . ... .. '' surgical addresses of homeland security policy in sundry areas of jurisdiction occupied by other committees would not be referred to the committee on homeland security on the basis of `` overall '' homeland security policy jurisdiction . for example , the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over a bill coordinating the homeland security efforts by all of the critical infrastructure protection sectors . jurisdiction over a bill addressing the protection of a particular sector would lie with the committee otherwise having jurisdiction over that sector . organization and administration of the department of homeland security -- the jurisdiction of the committee on homeland security would apply only to organizational or administrative aspects of the department where another committee 's jurisdiction did not clearly apply . the committee 's jurisdiction is to be confined to organizational and administrative efforts and would not apply to programmatic efforts within the department of homeland security within the jurisdiction of other committees . homeland security oversight -- this would vest the committee on homeland security with oversight jurisdiction over the homeland security community of the united states . nothing in this clause shall be construed as prohibiting or otherwise restricting the authority of any other committee to study and review homeland security activities to the extent that such activity directly affects a matter otherwise within the jurisdiction of that committee . individual committee concerns agriculture -- the jurisdiction of the committee on homeland security over `` border and port security '' shall be limited to agricultural importation and entry inspection activities of the department of homeland security under section 421 of the homeland security act of 2002 . the committee on agriculture shall retain jurisdiction over animal and plant disease policy including the authority reserved to the department of agriculture to regulate policy under section 421 of the homeland security act of 2002 , and the animal health protection act , the plant protection act , the plant quarantine act , and the agriculture quarantine inspection user fee account . the committee on agriculture shall retain jurisdiction over the agricultural research and diagnosis armed services -- the committee on armed services shall retain jurisdiction over warfighting , the military defense of the united states , and other military activities , including any military response to terrorism , pursuant to section 876 of the homeland security act of 2002 . energy and commerce -- the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over measures that address the department of homeland security 's activities for domestic preparedness and collective response to terrorism . the words `` to terrorism '' require a direct relation to terrorism . the committee on homeland security 's jurisdiction over `` collective response to terrorism '' means that it shall receive referrals of bills addressing the department of homeland security 's responsibilities for , and assistance to , first responders as a whole . the committee on energy and commerce ( and other relevant committees ) shall retain their jurisdiction over bills addressing the separate entities that comprise the first responders . for example , the committee on energy and commerce shall retain its jurisdiction over a bill directing the department of health and human services to train emergency medical personnel . financial services -- the committee on financial services shall retain jurisdiction over the national flood insurance program and emergency food and shelter program of fema , and the defense production act . the committee on financial services shall retain its jurisdiction over the anti-money laundering , terrorist financing , and anti-counterfeiting activities within the department of the treasury and the financial regulators . government reform -- the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over `` the organization and administration of the department of homeland security. '' the committee on government reform shall retain jurisdiction over federal civil service , the overall economy , efficiency , and management of government operations and activities , including federal procurement , and federal paperwork reduction . the committee on government reform shall retain jurisdiction over government-wide information management efforts including the federal information security management act . the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over intelligence -- the permanent select committee on intelligence shall retain jurisdiction over the intelligence and intelligence-related activities of all departments and agencies of the federal government , including the office of the director of national intelligence and the national counterterrorism center as defined in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 . judiciary -- the committee on the judiciary shall retain jurisdiction over immigration policy and non-border enforceme4tn of the immigration laws . its jurisdiction over immigration policy shall include matters such as the immigration and naturalization process , numbers of aliens ( including immigrants and non-immigrants ) allowed , classifications and lengths of allowable stay , the adjudication of immigration petitions and the requirements for the same , the domestic adjudication of immigration petitions and applications submitted to the department of labor or the department of homeland security and setting policy with regard to visa issuance and acceptance . its jurisdiction over non-border enforcement shall be limited to those aspects of immigration enforcement not associated with the immediate entry of individuals into the country , including those aspects of the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement . the science -- the committee on science shall retain some jurisdiction over the research and development activities of the department of homeland security as such matters are incidental to the committee on science 's existing jurisdiction ( except where those activities are in the jurisdiction of another committee ) . transportation and infrastructure -- the committee on transportation and infrastructure shall retain jurisdiction over the coast guard . however , the committee on homeland security has jurisdiction over port security , and some coast guard responsibilities in that area will fall within the jurisdiction of both committees . jurisdiction over emergency preparedness will be split between the committee on transportation and infrastructure and the committee on homeland security . the committee on transportation and infrastructure shall retain its jurisdiction under clause 1 ( r ) ( 2 ) over `` federal management of emergencies and natural disasters. '' this means that the committee retains its general jurisdiction over the emergency preparedness and response operations of the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) . bills addressing fema 's general preparation for disaster from any cause shall be referred as indicated earlier , the committee on homeland security 's jurisdiction over `` collective response to terrorism '' means that it would receive referrals of bills addressing the department of homeland security 's responsibilities for , and assistance to , first responders as a whole and not over measures addressing first responder communities individually . the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over the functions of the department of homeland security relating to transportation security , while the committee on transportation and infrastructure shall retain its jurisdiction over transportation safety . in general , the committee on homeland security would have jurisdiction over bills addressing the transportation security administration and the committee on transportation and infrastructure would have jurisdiction over bills addressing the various entities within the department of transportation having responsibility for transportation safety , such as the federal aviation administration and the federal motor carrier safety administration . the jurisdiction of the committee on homeland security does not ways and means -- the jurisdiction of the committee on ways and means over `` customs revenue '' is intended to include those functions contemplated in section 412 ( b ) ( 2 ) of the homeland security act of 2002 and includes those functions as carried out in collection districts and ports of entry and delivery . secretary of the treasury , date : may 15 , 2003 . subject : delegation from the secretary of the treasury to the secretary of homeland security of general authority over customs revenue functions vested in the secretary of the treasury as set forth in the homeland security act of 2002 . by virtue of the authority vested in me as the secretary of the treasury , including the authority vested by 31 u.s.c . 321 ( b ) and section 412 of the homeland security act of 2002 ( pub . l. 107-296 ) ( act ) , it is hereby ordered : 1 . consistent with the transfer of the functions , personnel , assets , and liabilities of the united states customs service to the department of homeland security as set forth in section 403 ( 1 ) of the act , there is hereby delegated to the secretary of homeland security the authority related to the customs revenue functions vested in the secretary of the treasury as set forth in sections 412 and 415 of the act , subject to the following exceptions and to paragraph 6 of this delegation of authority : ( a ) ( i ) the secretary of the treasury retains the sole authority to approve any regulations concerning import quotas or trade bans , user fees , marking , labeling , copyright and trademark enforcement , and the completion of entry or substance of entry summary including duty assessment and collection , classification , valuation , application of the u.s. harmonized tariff schedules , eligibility or requirements for preferential trade programs , and the establishment of recordkeeping requirements relating thereto . the secretary of homeland security shall provide a copy of all regulations so approved to the chairman and ranking member of the committee on ways and means and the chairman and ranking member of the committee on finance every six months .

"mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . ",R
"mr. speaker , i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time . the gentlewoman is correct : i currently serve on the committee on standards of official conduct . and despite what i read in the morning papers , the republican leadership is eliminating a major traditional ethics standard of the house . while we are relieved that the republican leadership did not go as far as they wanted to , i do not think we can be happy with the trend that is clearly downwards as it is today . the new rule means no ethics violations will be investigated of party leaders , whether they be republican or democratic , control their members , since a tie vote means a dismissal . the logical result is more partisan political pressure on the committee members . america was intended to be a city on a hill with the highest standards for the government in the world ; and sadly , today we are lowering those standards . the majority is proud of their political power and their skills at political games , and politics is an important part of our business ; but principles must be held above politics because no man can serve two masters , both principles and politics . when we are guided by only political consideration in the house leadership today , the house abandons its principles and the moral compass . i do not enjoy serving on the committee . i do know something about legislative ethics , having first been elected to the state house of representatives after a tremendous sharpstown bank scandal in texas 1972 . born and raised in texas , i understand what it means about conservative government , but i can not begin to explain how eliminating a traditional ethics standard is conservative in the slightest . the house leadership can fool some of the people some of the time , like they did today when the papers said they were dropping ethics changes , when they clearly continue to weaken the standards . however , the people recognize this for what it is , a weakening of our government 's ethics in pursuit of political parity by one party , be it democrat or republican . ",D
"mr. speaker , i am pleased that the rules package includes a provision that will make the homeland security committee a permanent committee . more importantly , we will be giving the committee real oversight and legislative jurisdiction . but i am disappointed that the majority has only given shared jurisdiction to the homeland security committee in some areas . this creates the potential for ongoing turf battles that the 9/11 commission warned against . i am also discouraged that the majority has decided to add a third day of suspension bills to the legislative calendar each week . an increasing amount of legislation is being passed by the house under a suspension of the rules . this is unnecessary and keeps us from doing the real business of the house -- budgeting , appropriations and oversight . a perfect example of this is the massive omnibus appropriations bill passed for fiscal year 2005 just a few weeks ago . this bill was rushed to the floor , ignoring the house rule requiring a 3-day review period before voting on conference reports . only after the house voted on the bill , careful scrutiny of the language uncovered a provision allowing certain members and staff access to any american 's tax return . not only was this an embarrassing episode for the house leadership , it continued a troubling trend . in 4 out of the last 5 years , the majority has made a massive omnibus bill the only option to fund the government . this take-it-or-leave-it approach is not acceptable and is fiscally irresponsible . congress has also been asleep at the switch when it comes to funding for iraq and the war on terrorism . this administration continues to fund the war on terrorism by supplemental appropriations . this is not a temporary war . congress needs to stand up to this white house , stand up for honest budgeting , and require that funding for iraq and the war on terrorism be made on-budget , and through the regular appropriations process . by appropriating through omnibus bills and budgeting by supplemental , congress is surrendering its constitutional duties . the results of this practice are ballooning deficits -- the cbo confirmed that the 2004 deficit is the largest in history , $ 413 billion -- a lack of follow-through to determine how appropriated funds are being spent . without proper oversight as a backstop , problems in the executive branch can spin out of control . members are learning about problems for the first time through the newspapers , not as a result of tough oversight hearings . this kind of lax or nonexistent oversight contributes to situations like we saw in abu ghraib prison . now we have learned about secret , permanent detention facilities in the united states where possible terrorists are held indefinitely , without any legal status . mr. speaker , we need to take a hard look at our priorities and get back to doing the business of the house . we should be moving forward with a tough , focused oversight agenda , and a schedule that devotes more time to priority , must-pass legislation and less time to suspension bills . instead , it appears that we are adopting a rules package today that will bring us more of the same . ",D
"mr. speaker , i thank the chairman for yielding me this time . i am going to support this rules package . i was not . i came here today fully expecting not to support it ; but because of the action taken last evening where we reconsidered some of the suggestions that had been made , i think we have a package now that we can live with . i think some of the recommendations that are in here are ill conceived , and i would hope to work with the chairman again in a bipartisan way with him and his committee and with the leadership to make some additional changes as we go through the process . but i want to thank him and thank the speaker and the leadership for accommodating my concerns about some of the amendments that i thought were the most difficult and the ones that created the biggest problem in trying to implement the code of official conduct . each of us , in fact all of us , individually and collectively , have a responsibility to maintain the highest standard of conduct for this house . and changes in the rules , as was said by the previous speaker , should strengthen , not weaken , those standards . as it stands now , i think the previous speaker said we are gutting the ethics committee standards now . we are not as it stands now . i would not be standing up here encouraging people to support the rules package if in any way i thought we were gutting it . we are tweaking it , and as i said earlier , we are tweaking some of it in a way that i wish we were not tweaking it , but it does not gut it . it is something that the rules work pretty well the way they are now , and this does not change that that much . i have had the privilege of serving on the committee on standards of official conduct since 1997 and have had an additional responsibility as serving as chairman since 2001 . and during that time , i have learned one paramount lesson : ethics must be bipartisan . the ethics process must be bipartisan . ethics reform must be bipartisan , and the ethics committee must be bipartisan . and i can tell the members the ethics committee is bipartisan . i see our ranking member over here . i could not have a better partner in this ethics process than the gentleman from west virginia ( mr. mollohan ) xz4002810 . the ethics committee is a bipartisan committee that follows the evidence wherever the evidence leads . meaningful ethics reform must be genuinely bipartisan . to have a bipartisan process , any significant change in the ethics rules must be made only after careful , thorough bipartisan consideration , as was done in 1989 and 1997 . in 1989 and 1997 , ethics reform came only after a broad consensus developed for change . i have always strongly supported reevaluating the ethics rules and procedures and making changes wherever a need is shown . i think a number of the criticisms of the ethics process that have been made over the past year are well taken and should be looked at . on the other hand , since i joined the committee , almost every significant decision , i believe every significant decision , has been made on a unanimous vote . despite the deletion of the amendment that i found the most objectionable to the code of conduct , the rules package includes a number of provisions that would make major changes in the ethics-related rules , but as to which neither the committee on standards of official conduct nor members outside the rules process were consulted . while i will not vote against the rules package because of these provisions , i urge the leadership to reconsider all the amendments added to the committee 's procedural rules without a bipartisan process . in 1997 the house , through a bipartisan task force , carefully studied the committee on standards of official conduct 's enforcement procedures , made a series of changes . the rules package includes provisions that would significantly alter those procedures . it would be a mistake to reverse these bipartisan determinations without a bipartisan process of our own . the 45-day thing that has been mentioned , i do not like that . i think that creates a problem in trying to implement a fair and even-handed ethics process . i would like to see that removed . when in 1997 the bipartisan task force report was before the house , the house significantly rejected , on a bipartisan vote of 181 to 236 , an amendment that would have required automatic dismissal of any complaint after 180 days , not 45 days . the reason for rejection of that amendment , as set out in the floor debate , is that such an artificial time limit on the life of a complaint would serve to encourage deadlock within the committee and partisanship among committee members . i could go on and on , mr. speaker . i think that is something we need to look at . the ranking member and i and the members of the ethics committee have been considering a group of suggestions that we would like to bring to the full house . we would like to do that , mr. speaker , shortly after the new session of congress convenes , when we are ready for that process . i think that is the way it ought to be done . these are the people that struggle with these issues every day . i think they ought to be concerned about what we think would make the process better . they do not have to follow it , but at least be concerned about it . the process in the house is not perfect . let us strive to make it perfect . on this one issue , let us act together on a bipartisan basis .

"mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . i thank the gentleman from colorado ( mr. hefley ) xz4001740 for his presentation . we were told the president wants to proceed on a bipartisan fashion in the next 4 years to deal with the important issues that confront our nation . i think that is appropriate and , hopefully , we will do that . however , on this first day , the rules package is usually a partisan package . it was when democrats were in charge ; it is now when republicans are in charge . that is understandable . but as the gentleman from colorado ( mr. hefley ) xz4001740 has so correctly pointed out , there was an exception , and that exception was dealing with the ethics of this institution which , in fact , deals with the confidence that the american public has in this institution . mr. speaker , the opening day of a new congress should be one in which the interests of this institution are paramount . the body of rules we adopt to govern debate , decorum , and the actions of our members should reflect that . to be sure , the american people who elected us to this great body can expect to see sharp differences on this floor over the substance of legislation . that is as the framers of the constitution planned . but the framers also intended , i believe , and the american people deserve to know , that this house is committed to holding its members to the highest ethical standards . today , as i think has been attested to by the gentleman from colorado ( mr. hefley ) xz4001740 , the house moves in the wrong direction . the rules proposed for the 109th house ignore the fundamental principle of protecting the ethics of this house . the proposed republican rules before us will seriously weaken the ability of the committee on standards of official conduct to enforce standards of integrity by providing that no action will be taken on a properly filed ethics complaint after 45 days unless the committee votes by a majority vote to take action . the gentleman from maryland ( mr. cardin ) xz4000640 will speak , who chaired with bob livingston , our former colleague , the amendment of these rules . under the current rules , which have functioned well since 1997 , a properly filed complaint that has not been addressed by the chair and ranking member or the committee itself automatically goes to an investigative subcommittee . that is as it should be . inaction ought not to be tantamount to dismissal . that is what this proposal does . the republican proposal would make it extremely difficult to investigate properly filed complaints . under this new rule , either side , either side will be able to guarantee a deadlock when a legitimate , factually strong ethics complaint against a member is filed , provided the chair or ranking member take no action . we have been told that the most egregious attempts to weaken the ethics systems have been abandoned . i beg to differ . the most egregious attempt is the one before us now currently remaining in this rule . let no one miss this distinction : the proposal to protect an indicted leader , a proposal that has been withdrawn by the majority , always was speculative , because we do not know if a leader will be indicted . in sharp contrast , however , the rule before us will have a concrete , demonstrable effect on every ethics complaint filed from this day forward . mr. speaker , the committee on standards of official conduct is the only mechanism that this institution has to police itself . when we weaken the committee , we weaken the standards that we are all expected to uphold , and we erode public confidence in this institution . the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 spoke eloquently to the maintenance of the status quo when he was in the minority urging us to be vigilant in rooting out unethical behavior in this institution . he was right then . he is not correct now in offering this rule which weakens that process . the adoption of this rule will substantially weaken our commitment to ensuring ethical conduct . i think the gentleman from colorado ( mr. hefley ) xz4001740 was right in his letter . i think he had the intellectual honesty and integrity on this floor when he spoke . he is going to vote for the rule because he believes that some offensive aspects of the proposal have been taken out . but i tell my friend that the most egregious , long-lasting , impacting change remains in this package . therefore , i urge my colleagues on behalf of the american people , on behalf of the integrity of this institution , on behalf of our commitment to ensure ethical conduct on behalf of the american people , that this not be passed .

"mr. speaker , i thank the distinguished gentlewoman because ethics equals integrity . i will submit my statement into the record . vote a resounding no on the resolution that is on the floor , and i hope that we will come before our peers and recognize that ethics equals integrity . mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the proposed changes to the house rules under the privileged resolution before the committee of the whole house . taken together , this package of proposals will gut the house rules . our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like to completely gut and render ineffective the current rule xi , which provides that a properly filed ethics complaint that has not been addressed by the chair and ranking member of the ethics committee gets referred to an investigative committee . the republican proposal would provide that , unless the committee votes by majority to take action on a properly filed complaint , no action will be taken after 45 days . this change to rule xi would take away an important oversight power and allow partisan politics to kill legitimate and colorable ethics complaints . a change like this would be an embarrassment to what this nation calls a `` democracy. '' furthermore , by allowing members to intentionally deadlock the vote of the ethics committee to kill a claim , we would be acting in contravention of the spirit of the u.s. constitution that guarantees procedural due process . we should strengthen the house ethnics rules rather than eviscerate them for the american people whom we represent . rules so relaxed that members can negotiate with a corporation , lobbying firm , or trade association that has business before their committee should not be further stripped . the honor that was bestowed upon this house upon its establishment must be maintained . members must be held accountable for their action . moreover , members should be given adequate time in which to read legislation that will be voted upon . since the legislation that we pass in this august body affects the entire nation -- which includes the districts represented by minority members , it is an injustice that insufficient time has been given for review of legislation . in the proposal that has been brought before the house does not contain the changes that are needed . it would be irresponsible for this body to accept what is before us . the proposed rule x amendment to create a standing committee on homeland security , on the other hand , is a smart one . it is only appropriate that this committee be made permanent and be given jurisdiction over `` overall homeland security policy. '' important organizational and admnistrative aspects of the department of homeland security , dhs , require oversight to ensure effective and efficient operation . dhs is a conglomeration of 22 federal agencies with more than 180 , 000 employees and a budget of $ 36 billion . because the department is still in its infancy stages , it is critical that committee oversight be applied to track and quickly eradicate deficiencies . the congress has just passed the national intelligence reform act , or s. 2845 , that will change the way our intelligence is collected and processed . dhs will be an important partner to our intelligence agencies in order to keep america safe . in addition , with the challenges that we have had with adequately funding first responders , it is very important that congress retain a close relationship to the department . mr. speaker , i oppose the rules package that is before this body , and i urge my colleagues to defeat it . i yield the balance of my time . further , a rules change that changes the quorum for this body without a constitutional change is minimally undermining our constitutional values . vote `` no '' on this resolution and `` yea '' on the motion to recommitt . ",D
"mr. speaker , i strongly oppose the radical new provision included in this rules package resolution which would violate the constitution by allowing the speaker and a small group of members to usurp the powers of a majority of the house and act with only a `` provisional quorum '' instead of the real thing . the proposal would deny the plain language of section 5 of article i of the constitution and create a new category of quorum -- a `` provisional quorum '' -- which the constitution expressly forbids . it destroys the very idea of the quorum . it would also demolish a 99-year-old precedent , based on the constitution , that a quorum of the house consists of a majority of the membership chosen , sworn , and living . for each house member deprived of the right to exert an impact on the work of the house , either through physical presence in or absence from the chamber , the approximately 600 , 000 persons represented by each member would be deprived of their rights to democratic representation in the legislative body structured to be closest to the american people . this proposal transfers the rights of those `` closest to the people '' to those closest to the house floor . the proposal takes the guise of a rules change which the house has no power to pass , since the constitution determines what kind of body the house is , and what it can -- and can not -- do . under this proposal , a majority of members of the house could be alive and well and fully cognizant , but unable to reach the floor , while the few who are present could usurp their authority and the powers of the house . article i , section 5 of the constitution states that a quorum consists of a majority , and , in the absence of a majority , all that the remaining minority of members of the house can do is either adjourn from day to day or vote to compel the attendance of absent members . there are no other options -- no matter how inconvenient that fact may be for any faction on the floor of the house during a time of emergency . the fact that the constitution authorizes a minority to compel the attendance of the absentees clearly indicates that the absentees are needed to conduct business . the constitution does not guarantee that a minority of the house will necessarily succeed in compelling the attendance of absent members to create a constitutional quorum . and such a result could indeed cause a crisis , which h. res. 5 would do nothing to remedy . unfortunately , during the last congress the house refused to make serious progress toward ensuring continuity of government . let 's consider how the plan before us today actually might operate . suppose that , in the aftermath of a catastrophic emergency which caused mass casualties and disrupted transportation and communications nationwide , a presiding officer existed in the house who might either be the speaker or another member of the house acting as `` speaker pro tempore '' from a list of names left by a deceased speaker . suppose that the presiding officer decided , if a quorum of the majority of members failed to appear within a specified time period , that members who were n't present on the house floor or any other designated place of meeting ceased to be members for purposes of determining a quorum . suppose the rump minority of members who had managed to reach the floor wanted to pass major legislation , including a declaration of war or authorization for use of military force , send constitutional amendments to the states for ratification , expel members from their seats , or elect a new speaker to become acting president of the united states , all using a `` provisional quorum '' of one-half of the members present , plus one . could they do these things ? the proposed rule says they could . the constitution says they could not . the resolution gives the member presiding the effective power to temporarily define out of existence those members who do n't respond to a specified series of quorum calls . these members ' seats would not be considered vacant , but they would fall into a kind of extra-constitutional limbo until the missing members -- or a majority of the total membership -- reappeared in the house . it is even possible that some states might seek to replace members who do not answer the `` provisional quorum '' call in the house by ordering special elections even though the members might be known to be alive . all members are equal under the constitution , and the right to membership in this house is not determined by a speaker , speaker pro tempore , or a rump of a minority of the body . it is determined by a vote of the people , and only a constitutionally constituted house may exercise the power to determine the qualifications of its members and whether they have been duly elected . the supreme court has ruled that the house may not add qualifications for membership beyond those expressly stated in the constitution . if a member has been duly elected and taken the oath , he remains a member , and can only be removed through resignation , or through expulsion . there is no constitutional requirement that a member must appear on the floor to maintain membership , or that house membership can somehow lapse . it is surprising that some who only last year during debate on the `` continuity of representation act '' , h.r. 2844 , spoke eloquently about the status of a house consisting only of members elected by the people are now supporting a proposal to define those elected members out of existence . members who are trapped at an airport because the transportation system is inoperative , for example , do not simply cease to exist , nor can their powers be vested in other members , willingly or not . their absence has potential consequences , including the inability of the house to act until the collective body is `` assembled '' again , as the constitution requires . the resolution would also do an end run around the issue of `` disability '' , a matter not addressed in the constitution and one which requires a constitutional amendment to resolve , as the 25th amendment did in the case of the president . disabled members -- whom we might describe as those either physically injured or mentally incapable so as to be incapable of participating in the work of the house -- have the same status as those who are fully functional . the constitution makes no mention of disabled members , but it does not give the house the power to pretend they do n't exist . the house has never expelled or otherwise attempted to remove a sitting member on the grounds of disability . proponents of the proposal before us today claim to address the problem of incapacitated members , but only by effectively ignoring it . under the provisional quorum rule , these members would presumably not be able to appear on the floor and would be automatically excluded from the provisional quorum . it 's a very convenient solution to the disability problem , though blatantly unconstitutional . the house could adopt the provisional quorum plan as a house rule if the constitution were amended to authorize it to do so ; however , the constitution does not . the argument that the house is somehow exercising a constitutional power to make its own rules is also spurious . the house may only make rules which the constitution permits it to make . the house may not reinvent itself at will as a different kind of legislative body by pretending that it is simply changing its rules . at the very least , the house should debate the provisional quorum issue as a separate resolution , following hearings by the rules committee , with the speaker in the chair to signal the historic nature of the debate and the radical action proposed to be taken . burying the issue within this resolution with other controversial rule changes is an outrage . the 108th congress proved to be a huge disappointment because of its failure to effectively address many issues involving the stability of our structure of government , deficiencies brought to the forefront by the september 11 attacks , as well as a disturbing tendency to paper over controversies with legislation which fails to substantively address the problem . for example , the house rejected a constitutional amendment offered by representative baird of washington which would have reconstituted the house quickly through temporary appointments , pending special elections , if a large number of members were killed . i had introduced a different version of the proposal , h.j. res. 89 . members opposed to the concept -- which is admittedly extremely controversial -- refused to allow real hearings and debate . even though prospects for passage of a constitutional amendment were extremely slim , a substantial debate would have served to educate the congress and the american people on the importance of these issues , and perhaps provide impetus in a search for alternatives . a major effort like this has to start somewhere . instead , the house passed , but the senate subsequently did not consider , h.r. 2844 , the `` continuity of representation act '' , which created an unrealistically fast , unfair , undemocratic and unworkable scheme to fill vacant house seats through a mandatory national 45-day special election period . this bill was referred principally to the house administration committee , where i was able to make an official record of its many flaws . neither house passed simple legislation which would have corrected an oversight in the legislation creating the department of homeland security in 2002 , which failed to place the supposedly critical new cabinet officer somewhere -- anywhere -- in the statutory line of success to the presidency . though hearings were held , neither house addressed significant issues of presidential succession , such as the role of the speaker and president pro tempore and lame duck cabinet members in the succession lineup , and the ability of some officials to `` bump '' others serving as acting president under the current federal statute . mr. speaker , i plan to urge further action on congressional continuity issues in the new year , to work with my colleagues on the committee on house administration to assert our own jurisdiction more effectively and to push other relevant committees to do the same . we need both more effective action , and better internal cooperation , to accomplish these goals . the material previously referred to by ms. slaughter xz4003780 is as follows : explanation of 3-day layover supermajority vote requirement 1 . committee reports . clause 4 ( a ) ( 1 ) of rule xiii requires committee-reported bills to lay over for three days before consideration in the house . the purpose of this rule , which dates from the legislative reorganization act of 1970 , is to give members who did not participate in committee deliberations time to consider the committee 's work . the three-day layover period gives members time to familiarize themselves with the legislation and to prepare for house debate , which could include drafting amendments to the committee-reported bill . when he was a minority rules committee member , chairman dreier explained the importance of this rule in the following way : `` why is it that we have the 3-day layover ? very simple , mr. speaker , i do not think you would enter into a business agreement or purchase a home or engage in any kind of major activity without having read it first . the idea behind the 3-day layover is very simple . it is there so that we may in fact allow members to have the opportunity to review legislation before they exercise their constitutional right and vote for it or against it. '' althoug chairman dreier was very critical of special rules that waived the 3-day layover when he was a minority rules committee member , his committee routinely reports special rules waiving 3-day layover of committee-reported legislation . in the 108th congress , the rules committee waived the 3-day layover of committee-reported legislation 31 times . the purpose of this amendment is to restore regular order to the committee reporting process . it would allow the house to adopt a rule waiving the 3-day layover of committee-reported legislation only with a two-thirds vote -- in the same way the house must approve a rule calling for same-day consideration of a bill by a two-thirds vote . 2 . conference reports . house-senate conferences are a critical part of the congressional deliberative process because they produce the final legislative product that becomes the law of the land . the conference is where the final compromises are made and the final statutory language on the bill 's toughest issues is negotiated and drafted . as chairman dreier wrote back in 1993 : `` deliberative democracy is just as important at the end of the legislative process as it is at the formative subcommittee stages or the amendatory floor stage . in fact , the case can be made that it is even more important that congress be fully informed and deliberate on that final product since that is the version that will become law. '' because only a restricted group of house members participate in conferences and because conference reports can contain significant policy changes from the house-approved version of a bill , the standing house rules provide members a number of protections against the conference process . perhaps the most important protection is the one found in clause 8 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ) of house rules xxii , which requires conference reports and joint explanatory statements to lay over for three days after publication in the congressional record . the purpose of this rule is very clear . since most members do not participate in the conference , they need time to study and familiarize themselves with the conference product . conference reports on major legislation run sometimes hundreds although conference reports are privileged and could come directly to the floor for consideration without a rule , they are routinely considered under special rules because they are often in technical violation of one or more sections of rule xxii or the budget act of 1974 . while it is understandable that the majority may need to use special rules to waive certain points of order against the content or consideration of conference reports in particular situations , the majority has made it the practice to grant `` blanket waivers '' to virtually every conference report the house considers . twenty-five of the 28 special one of the troubling consequences of this policy is that members only learn about the details of a conference report after it has already passed the house . some of these conference reports reconfirm the truth of the old saying that `` the devil is in the details. '' chairman dreier made this very same argument , when , as a minority rules committee member , he opposed waiving the 3-day layover on conference reports . he wrote : `` the house and senate have been repeatedly embarrassed over the years by conference reports on voluminous pieces of legislation which have been voted on before even properly printed or distributed , let alone understood . only after their enactment have some of the provisions come back to haunt the congress. '' the 108th congress has had its share of embarrassing episodes involving the quick approval of conference reports that were later discovered to contain controversial provisions added into bills during the conference stage . for example : one of the earliest actions of the 108th congress was to repeal the embarrassing provision republican leaders had slipped into the homeland security conference report at the end of the 107th congress that protected eli lilly and a number of other pharmaceutical companies from civil liability for their production of the vaccine preservative thimerosal . the energy bill conference added scores of obscure provisions that had not appeared in the house or senate bills , including the embarrassing `` greenbonds initiative , '' which turned out to be subsidy to build a hooters restaurant in shreveport , louisiana . the recent conference report for the fy05 omnibus funding bill included a provision giving appropriations committee members and staff access to the internal revenue service tax returns of u.s. citizens . to avoid future embarrassing episodes such as these and to restore members ' rights to have three days to study a conference report , this section would allow the house to adopt a rule waiving the 3-day layover of conference report only with a two-thirds vote . previous questions for h. res. 5 -- 109th congress opening day rules package in section 2 : amendment to h. res. 5 offered by ms. slaughter xz4003780 of new york strike section 2 ( k ) ( 2 ) ( relating to dismissal of complaints ) and redesignate the succeeding paragraph accordingly. & lt ; p & gt ; ",D
"mr. speaker , i strongly oppose the changes in the house ethics rules that the republican majority is seeking to adopt today . the proposed republican rule changes would cripple the ethics process in the house and dramatically lower the bar for standards of official conduct . late yesterday , the republican majority in the house released the details of its rules package for the 109th congress . some of the newspapers reported this morning that the majority had abandoned its efforts to loosen rules governing members ' ethical conduct , but this is not the case . while the majority backed away from some of its rule changes , the most egregious ethics change remains . this provision would make it much more difficult for the committee on standards of official conduct to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by members of the house . under current rules , if the ethics committee deadlocks on whether or not to pursue an ethics complaint against a member of the house , the matter automatically goes to an investigative subcommittee . under the proposed change , a complaint against a member would be tabled unless a majority votes to take action on it within 45 days . since the committee is evenly split with five republicans and five democrats , either political party could simply block an ethics complaint by stonewalling and running out the clock . there is no doubt that if the proposed rule change had been in effect during the last congress , no action would have been taken against the members of the house who were reprimanded as a result of the ethics committee 's investigation of bribery allegations raised in connection with the vote on the medicare prescription drug act of 2003 . the committee would have deadlocked and the entire matter swept under the rug 45 days after the complaint was made . i was listening to the debate on this earlier . the chairman of the ethics committee said that he does not favor this change . he said he would like it removed . why then is the majority leadership pursuing this change , when it is opposed by the ranking republican on the ethics committee ? at a time when public confidence in congress is so low and the nation faces so many challenges , it is inexplicable that the first order of business in the new session is to water down the ethics rules in the house and make it even more difficult to discipline lawmakers who abuse their office . this should not be a partisan matter . the proposed rule change harms the integrity and credibility of the house as an institution , and that reflects badly on all of us , republicans and democrats alike . i urge all my colleagues to join me in opposing this assault on ethics enforcement in the house . ",D
"mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the proposed changes in the ethics rules . i served for 8 years on the committee on standards of official conduct , and it is not an enviable assignment . but members who have never served on the committee would be proud of how these tasks are approached . it is a committee that is evenly split . in the 8 years i served , we had unanimous votes . the members who serve think about the institution . they are there to serve the american people and the institution . it has not been a partisan body . it has been one that holds other members to a high ethical standard . these rules will undermine the committee on standards of official conduct , and the process of using the committee on rules rather than the committee on standards of official conduct to deliberate on the changes is also undercutting the committee on standards of official conduct . i recommend that we do not support these rule changes . and i also want to mention on the homeland security provision of the rule , it is a huge mistake to `` murky up '' the jurisdiction over cybersecurity . we are at tremendous risk for a cyberattack , and the changes in that area will make us less safe . ",D
"mr. speaker , i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time . mr. speaker , the first day of a new congress should be a day for hope . it should be a day when all of us look forward with optimism to the work ahead . but today is not that kind of day . instead , the leadership of this house is beginning the new year in the worst possible way , by gutting the ethical standards of the united states house of representatives . talk about starting off on the wrong foot . in the rules package before us today , the republican leadership is sending a very clear message . they are admitting that they are so ethically challenged that they can not conform to the rules they previously adopted , so they must now relax those rules . what an awful example to the nation and to the rest of the world . we should be strengthening the ethical standards of this house , not weakening them . mr. speaker , the republican party regained a majority of seats in this body in 1994 , in part by promising greater accountability and a more honest system in the nation 's capital . their actions have been anything but honest ; and now with this rules package , their rush to the bottom continues . today is just one more example of the ethical lapses we have seen in this house , a house where major legislation is now written by industry lobbyists , a house where members are not even given the courtesy of being able to read bills before they are voted on , and a house where bad behavior is not reprimanded , but rewarded . as members of congress , we should be held to the highest possible ethical standards . that means not breaking the law . that means not dancing around the law , and that means conducting ourselves in a manner that reflects credibility on the house at all times . facing the possible indictment of a member of their leadership , the republicans attempted in secret to change the rules to protect their ethically challenged colleagues . however , in the face of mounting public controversy , the public leadership caved last night and rescinded the change . they blinked and they buckled . but the speaker 's spokesman commented on this flip-flop saying that the issue had become a `` distraction. '' not wrong , mind you , but just distracting . i am getting whiplash just watching all this stuff . but , mr. speaker , let us be clear that the republican leadership did not find religion in this issue . if they believed that what they were about to do was truly wrong , they would not have proposed these rule changes in the first place . but while republicans try to pull a fast one claiming that the majority leader fell on his sword for the good of his party , the truth is that the rules package for the 109th congress still in a very meaningful way fundamentally weakens the ethics system here in the house of representatives . i strongly urge the american people and members of the press and my colleagues to closely examine these rule changes , especially those made to the ethics standards . under the old rules , a properly filed ethics complaint is automatically investigated if that complaint is not acted upon within 45 days . remember , as the gentlewoman from new york stated , that the ethics committee is evenly divided between democrats and republicans ; and to ensure that partisan politics did not prevail in the ethics process , a tie vote ensures a formal investigation . but under this proposed rules package , there must be a majority vote to investigate a properly filed ethics complaint ; and if that complaint is not acted upon with within 45 days , that ethics complaint dies . in other words , mr. speaker , the chairman of the committee , whoever that may be , could stonewall the process , refuse to call for a vote , and ultimately kill any ethics complaint without any action . but this also allows any member potentially under investigation to run the clock out by stonewalling investigators until the 45 days are up . the american people deserve better than this from their elected representatives . we serve at the pleasure of our constituents , and we have a responsibility to uphold the highest ethical standards . over the past decade , the republican leadership has careened down the pathway of irresponsibility , and now we are at a crossroads . there are those of us who truly believe members of congress should be held to a higher standard and who will make a stand and fight for real accountability from our colleagues , and there will be those who blindly follow their leadership , who vote to weaken the rules of this institution , first written by thomas jefferson , because they fear the retribution of their leaders . this should be a place where honesty and integrity are the standard , not a place where the rules are changed merely to protect a powerful few from their own ethical shortcomings . mr. speaker , we can stop this debacle . let us start over . let us make this right . let us make the house of representatives an example of high standards and ethical decency . i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on this rules package . ",D
"mr. speaker , i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from maryland ( mr. hoyer ) xz4001890 , the distinguished minority whip . ",D
"mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the rules package . every house member should vote to put the house on record against ethical and procedural abuses that contaminate this institution . the stench of special interest corruption is overwhelming congress , and repulsing the public . it is time the house rules reflected the ethical standards and common sense of the american people . i came to this house 30 years ago , and our historic incoming class brought with it one of the strongest tides of reform ever seen : rules were changed , chairmen were replaced , procedures were modernized so that the voice of the people was heard , and respected , in this house of the people . ten years ago , the republicans took control of the house , promising a new era of reform . to read the national newspapers , it is evident to everyone -- except themselves -- that the republicans have betrayed their promise of reform . they have tolerated misconduct and enshrined special interests as never before . today , we give them , and all members , an opportunity to restore public trust by voting for two commonsense amendments to the house rules . first , no sitting member should negotiate for a new job with any organization that has had business before his or her committee for a year . that 's not hard to understood : no one should be shaping public policy with an eye on a future private sector salary . second , no bill should be brought to the house floor unless members have had 3 days to read it first . that 's not hard to understand : we should not be passing bills that are hundreds of pages in length -- sometimes over 1 , 000 pages -- without ever having seen what is in the bill . ronald reagan thought it was a bad idea ; surely today 's house republicans can agree . let 's be honest about it : 99 percent of the american people outside the beltway will agree with both of these principles -- no negotiating for new jobs with special interests ; members should know what they are voting on before it becomes law . we should n't even have to have a debate . but we do . less than a month ago , the nation was stunned to learn that the committee chairman who had fashioned a blatantly pro-drug industry , anti-senior , anti-consumer prescription drug law was retiring and taking a job with the pharmaceutical industry . in fact , our former colleague assumes his job with phrma today , just as we are taking our oaths of office . mr. tauzin will reportedly be earning a salary nearly 13 times what he earned when he wrote that pro-industry bill -- one of the best paid lobbyists in washington . he earned it . that prescription drug law will enrich him , but it takes billions of dollars out of the pockets of america 's senior citizens -- by prohibiting them from purchasing cheaper drugs from canada , and by prohibiting the federal government from negotiating with the pharmaceutical industry -- his new employer -- for lower drug prices . that 's worth billions to the drug industry . while the deal was not announced until last month , the discussions began a year ago , as was widely reported at the time . in fact , a top aide to the republican leadership was quoted last january 24 on cnn.com as saying that republican congressman tauzin 's negotiation with pharma `` does n't look very good. '' it does n't look `` very good '' today either , as millions of seniors face higher drug prices thanks to the tauzin bill , and bill tauzin takes office to improve the tattered image of the drug industry . we all know this stinks . and so do our constituents . let 's put an end to it today by barring negotiations for private jobs by members of congress . that 's what our constituents would want us to do . and at the same time , let 's put an end to the outrageous practice of voting on complex and lengthy bills before congress has had time to read them -- bills like that prescription drug bill bill tauzin wrote while he was listening to pharma 's whispers in his ears . is n't it bad enough that republicans majority writes the bills in secret , without input from the democrats who represent 48 percent of the country ? without scrutiny by the press ? without review by the public must we also vote on secret legislation , without reading it , without knowing the tax breaks and earmarked spending for special interests that have been stuck in without any review ? i urge all members to put party aside and vote the way your constituents would want you to vote : an end to private job negotiations while serving in public office , and full disclosure of the contents of legislation before we vote . mr. speaker , i also vigorously oppose the proposed rule change that would allow an ethics investigation to end after 45 days of the ethics committee of five democrats and five republicans remained deadlocked . today , the republicans are once again putting partisan politicians ahead of ethics by moving forward with their plan to shield their embattled majority leader -- tom delay -- from any further investigation . the goal of this change is to block the ethics committee from considering pending and future matters that could prove to be damaging to their party . under the present rules , if the chair and the ranking minority member of the ethics committee can not agree whether to investigate a complaint , the committee begins an initial investigation into the matter . but , under the republicans ' proposed rule change , the republican chairman of the ethics committee -- who is handpicked by the speaker -- could simply refuse to examine a complaint . after 45 days , the complaint would be dropped , without even an initial investigation into the matter . this new rule would allow republicans to block pending ethics matters and prevent future investigations from moving forward . and the reason is very simple : there are at least two matters currently pending against republican leaders , including majority leader tom delay . contrary to this morning 's press reports , the republicans have n't backed away from their attempts to shield delay from further investigation , they 've simply become a little more deceptive in how they 're doing it . last year , when the ethics committee admonished delay three times , it deferred action on another serious charge -- his role in funneling illegal soft money into texas races through his state pac -- until after the investigation against him had been completed . the rule change now proposed by his republican colleagues would allow the republican chairman of the committee to block any further investigation of delay 's activities , shielding the minority leader from further admonishments even if he is indicted by a grand jury . also pending is an investigation of republican lobbyist , jack abramoff , and former delay staffer , michael scanlon , and their ties to several republican members . changing the ethics rules would permit the republicans to halt any investigation of the abramoff scandal and the members who could be implicated in their outrageous looting of native americans . i urge a `` no '' vote on this unbalanced and improper rules package . ",D
"mr. speaker , i would like to address the ethics-related provisions that are in this package at the insistence of the committee on rules . i had the honor of serving as ranking member of the committee on standards of official conduct in the last congress . it was an honor to serve with the gentleman from colorado ( chairman hefley ) , as he always managed to chair the committee in a completely bipartisan manner . the headlines in this morning 's paper say `` gop abandons ethics changes. '' it turns out that the headline is at best only half right . it is true that the most outrageous ethics undermining provision has been deleted from the rules package , but other provisions , provisions that would make major changes in the way the committee on standards of official conduct handles enforcements of the rules , they remain . there should be no misunderstanding that these provisions that remain would seriously undermine the ethics process in the house , both because of the changes they would make in committee procedures , but , and equally important , because of the partisan way in which they are being adopted . if there is to be a meaningful , viable ethics process in the house , it must be a genuinely bipartisan process . that point should be self-evident . how could there be a legitimate ethics process that is operated on a partisan basis ? and to have a bipartisan process , it is absolutely essential that any major changes in the rules be made on a truly bipartisan basis . what is more , because of the importance and the sensitive nature of the ethics rules , it is also essential that any proposed changes be considered in a thoughtful , considered , and open way , with all members being given the opportunity for input , democrats and republicans . until today , the house recognized these fundamental points . until today , the house has not attempted to make major changes in the ethics rules or the committee on standards of official conduct procedures in a slapdash way , with literally only hours of consideration , and on a party line vote . it will probably come as no surprise that the materials issued by the committee on rules that attempt to justify these amendments are based entirely on misstatements of the current rules . for example , under the benign sounding heading , `` restore presumption of innocence , '' the committee on rules memorandum states , `` currently , if the chairman and ranking minority member take no action on a properly filed complaint within 45 days , the matter automatically goes to an investigative subcommittee. '' fine . but that statement is incomplete and , therefore , misleading . the rules that have been in effect since 1997 clearly provide that at any time that a complaint is before the chairman and ranking member for consideration , either one of them may place the complaint on the committee 's agenda and when either one of them does that , an investigative committee can not be established without a majority vote of the committee . another example , mr. speaker . under the heading `` due process for members , '' the committee on rules memorandum states that , `` under the current rule , the chairman and ranking member or the committee may take action against a member without a complaint , notice , or the opportunity to be heard. '' this statement clearly implies that the committee may determine that a member has committed a violation or impose a sanction without the member having such rights , and that suggestion , mr. speaker , is flatly wrong . the rules are replete with the rights for members who are accused of any violation . when you turn to the actual text of the `` due process '' amendments , you find that what these amendments are concerned with is not committee actions that impose sanctions or determine violations , but instead on committee letters or statements that `` reference the official conduct of a member. '' it may be well that the rules should provide certain rights to a member whose conduct is going to be discussed in a letter or statement that the committee issues publicly , but what should those rights be ? they should be determined through a deliberative , fair , bipartisan process . but one specific right that this proposed rule provides to those members is the right to demand an immediate trial in front of an adjudicatory subcommittee of the committee on standards of official conduct . but in the circumstances that the rule addresses , that trial would take place before the committee has conducted any formal investigation of the matter . no committee that is serious about conducting its business would allow itself to be put in that circumstance . so the effect of this amendment would be that whenever any alleged misconduct is brought to the committee 's attention , the committee may be forced to choose between either launching a formal investigation of the matter or dismissing it entirely . both of these rule changes lack careful consideration and , more seriously , are brought to us today through a partisan process . i 'd like to address the ethics-related provisions that are in this package at the insistence of the rules committee . i had the honor of serving as ranking member of the ethics committee in the last congress , and i also served on the committee for 6 years during another time of controversy in the late 1980s . it was an honor to serve during the last 2 years with chairman hefley , as he always managed the committee in a completely bipartisan manner . a headline in this morning 's newspaper says , `` gop abandons ethics changes. '' it turns out that the headline is at best only half right . it 's true that the most outrageous ethics-undermining provision has been deleted from the rules package , but other provisions -- provisions that would make major changes in the way the ethics committee handles enforcement of the rules -- remain . there should be no misunderstanding that these provisions that remain would seriously undermine the ethics process in the house , both because of the changes they would make in committee procedures , and , equally important , because of the partisan way in which they would be adopted . if there is to be a meaningful , viable ethics process in the house , it must be a genuinely bipartisan process . that point should be self-evident -- how could there be a legitimate ethics process that is operated on a partisan basis ? and to have a bipartisan process , it 's absolutely essential that any major changes in the rules be made on a truly bipartisan basis . what 's more , because of the importance , and the sensitive nature of the ethics rules , it 's also essential that any proposed changes be considered in a thoughtful , considered , and open way , with all members being given the opportunity for input -- democrats and republicans . until today , the house recognized these fundamental points . until today , the house has not attempted to make major changes in the ethics rules or the ethics committee procedures in a slapdash way , with literally only hours of consideration , and on a party-line vote . it will probably come as no surprise that the materials issued by the rules committee that attempt to justify these amendments are based entirely on misstatements of the current rules . for example , under the benign-sounding heading , `` restore presumption of innocence , '' the rules committee memorandum states , and i quote : `` currently , if the chairman and ranking minority member take no action on a properly filed complaint within 45 days , the matter automatically goes to an investigative subcommittee.

'' it may well be that the rules should provide certain rights to a member whose conduct is going to be discussed in a letter or statement that the committee issues publicly , but what should those rights be ? they should be determined through a deliberative , fair , bipartisan process . but one specific right that this proposed rule provides to those members is the right to demand an immediate trial in front of an adjudicatory subcommittee of the ethics committee . but in the circumstances that the rule addresses , that trial would take place before the committee has conducted any formal investigation of the matter . no committee that is serious about conducting its business would allow itself to be put in that circumstance . so the effect of this amendment would be that whenever any alleged misconduct is brought to the committee 's attention , the committee may be forced to choose between either launching a formal investigation of the matter , or dismissing it entirely . there would be no chance for an expedited but the proposed amendment that raises even more concern is the one that provides for automatic dismissal of any complaint that is not acted upon within a period as short as 45 days . when the house last considered ethics committee procedures , in 1997 , it rejected , on a bipartisan vote , an amendment that would have required the automatic dismissal of any complaint that is not acted upon within 180 days . the reason that amendment was rejected is that it was recognized that such a time limit would encourage deadlock on the committee , and partisanship among the committee members . under a time limit , if one side or the other is uncomfortable about dealing with a particular complaint , those members do n't have to discuss it or otherwise try to deal with it -- by their just doing nothing , the complaint will disappear . yet now this provision for automatic dismissal has reappeared , and this time it has a far shorter time frame for committee consideration than the nearly identical provision that the house soundly rejected in 1997 . i want to close by asking all members , including all members of the leadership on both sides of the aisle , to give some serious consideration -- not just today , but in the weeks and months ahead -- to whether you genuinely want to have a meaningful ethics process in the house , and what we as members , individually and collectively , have to do in order for such a process to exist . as i said at the outset , for this process to exist , it has to be a truly bipartisan one , and it has to be treated with seriousness and respect . it has to be recognized that the basic purpose of the process is to consider and address legitimate ethics concerns , and if members are successful in using the process for partisan , political purposes , it is going to fail . the approval of these amendments would seriously undermine the process and , for that reason alone , this rules package should be defeated . ",D
"mr. speaker , i rise in support of the point of order . the constitution defines a quorum to conduct business as the majority of each house . the question of course before us in this debate is , a majority of what ? what is the denominator in that equation ? the precedent holds that the total number of the membership of the house is those members who are chosen , sworn and living and whose membership has not been terminated by action of the house . removal by action of the house is also a defined term , expulsion by a vote of two-thirds in article 1 , section 5. the constitution also gives the house the authority to compel attendance when members do not answer the call of the chair in such manner and under such penalties as each house may provide . and , in fact , the sergeant at arms has been sent to gather members by force on prior occasions . this amendment before us to the rules gives the speaker nearly unfettered authority to change the number of the members of the whole house to exclude members who are chosen , sworn , and living but who do not answer the call of the chair . this would seem to amount to a constructive expulsion without a two-thirds vote of the whole house . for example , suppose the house is at its full complement of 435 members . a quorum would then be 218 . now , suppose only 400 members answer the speaker 's call for whatever reason . they are still living . they are still chosen . they are still sworn . they have not been expelled . now a quorum by order of the speaker would be 200 . the house may conduct its business with only 200 members present . if this is triggered in a time of national emergency , the consequences could be dire . mr. speaker , we heard the distinguished chair , or maybe he is only the presumptive chair , of the committee on rules , at this point ; but in any event , the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 said a moment ago that this proposed rules change is constitutional because the constitution could not have contemplated that the house could not function . but the constitution did not contemplate that the majority of the members of the house might in fact be the victims of an act of mass terrorism . those things were not contemplated at the time . the fact is we do need to amend the constitution to take care of this very serious question ; but this provision for the reasons stated by the gentleman from washington ( mr. baird ) xz4000110 , for the reasons that i stated a moment ago , is clearly unconstitutional . certainly , before we take such a measure , it deserves much more extensive debate and hearings and discussion than it can have by three or four speakers in this context now . so i urge that members take careful consideration to the question of constitutionality here . this may provoke court action , and we should not adopt this now in the context of an overall rules change with this very serious amendment to the constitution , which is what it amounts to ; it can not receive adequate consideration in terms of its constitutionality either in terms of its merit .

"mr. speaker , i am transmitting a status report on the current levels of on-budget spending and revenues for fiscal year 2005 and for the 5-year period of fiscal years 2005 through 2009 . this report is necessary to facilitate the application of sections 302 and 311 of the congressional budget act and section 401 of the conference report on the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2005 ( s. con . res. 95 , which is currently in effect as a concurrent resolution on the budget in the house under h. res. 5 ) . this status report is current through january 21 , 2005 . the term `` current level '' refers to the amounts of spending and revenues estimated for each fiscal year based on laws enacted or awaiting the president 's signature . the first table in the report compares the current levels of total budget authority , outlays , and revenues with the aggregate levels set forth by s. con . res. 95 . this comparison is needed to enforce section 311 ( a ) of the budget act , which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the budget resolution 's aggregate levels . the table does not show budget authority and outlays for years after fiscal year 2005 because appropriations for those years have not yet been considered . the second table compares the current levels of budget authority and outlays for discretionary action by each authorizing committee with the `` section 302 ( a ) '' allocations made under s. con . res. 95 for fiscal year 2005 and fiscal years 2005 through 2009 . `` discretionary action '' refers to legislation enacted after the adoption of the budget resolution . this comparison is needed to enforce section 302 ( f ) of the budget act , which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the section 302 ( a ) discretionary action allocation of new budget authority for the committee that reported the measure . it is also needed to implement section 311 ( b ) , which exempts committees that comply with their allocations from the point of order under section 311 ( a ) . the third table compares the current levels of discretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2005 with the `` section 302 ( b ) '' suballocations of discretionary budget authority and outlays among appropriations subcommittees . the comparison is also needed to enforce section 302 ( f ) of the budget act because the point of order under that section equally applies to measures that would breach the applicable section 302 ( b ) suballocation . the fourth table gives the current level for 2006 of accounts for advance appropriations under section 401 s. con . res. 95 . this list is needed to enforce section 401 of the budget resolution , which creates a point of order against appropriation bills that contain advance appropriations that are : ( i ) not identified in the statement of managers or ( ii ) would cause the aggregate amount of such appropriations to exceed the level specified in the resolution . enactment of measures providing new budget authority for fiscal year 2005 in excess of $ 46 , 377 , 000 , 000 ( if not already included in the current level estimate ) would cause fiscal year 2005 budget authority to exceed the appropriate level set by s. con . res. 95 enactment of measures providing new outlays for fiscal year 2005 in excess of $ 21 , 374 , 000 , 000 ( if not already included in the current level estimate ) would cause fiscal year 2005 outlays to exceed the appropriate level set by s. con . res. 95 . enactment of measures that would reduce revenue for fiscal year 2005 ( if not already included in the current level estimate ) would cause revenues to fall further below the appropriate level set by s. con . res. 95 . enactment of measures resulting in revenue reduction for the period of fiscal years 2005 through 2009 ( if not already included in the current level estimate ) would cause revenues to fall further below the appropriate levels set by s. con . res. 95 . appropriate level & lt ;

p & gt ; u.s. congress , congressional budget office , washington , dc , january 24 , 2005 . dear mr . chairman : the enclosed report shows the effects of congressional action on the fiscal year 2005 budget and is current through january 21 , 2004 . this report is submitted under section 308 ( b ) and in aid of section 311 of the congressional budget act , as amended . the estimates of budget authority , outlays , and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of s. con . res. 95 , the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2005 . the budget resolution figures incorporate revisions submitted by the committee on the budget to the house to reflect funding for wildland fire suppression and for technical reasons . these revisions are authorized by sections 312 and 313 of s. con . res. 95 . in addition , under section 402 of s. con . res. 95 , amounts designated as emergency requirements are exempt from enforcement of the budget resolution . as a result , the enclosed current level report excludes these amounts ( see footnote 2 of the report ) . since my last letter , dated november 17 , the congress has cleared and the president has signed the following acts that changed budget authority , outlays , or revenues for fiscal year 2005 : the second continuing resolution , 2005 ( public law 108-416 ) ; the miscellaneous trade and technical corrections act ( public law 108-429 ) ; the third continuing resolution , 2005 ( public law 108-434 ) ; the consolidated appropriations act , 2005 ( public law 108-447 ) ;

"mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to h. res. 5 , to the republican rules package . specifically , i oppose the proposed changes to rule x , which among other things creates a permanent standing committee on homeland security and grants legislative jurisdiction to that committee . i am not opposed to the creation of a permanent homeland security committee . indeed , i believe that the homeland security committee should be made permanent and should be granted jurisdiction over the overall homeland security policy of the federal government . further , i believe that a homeland security committee is needed to oversee the internal administration of such a large federal agency as the department of homeland security , dhs , which has over 180 , 000 employees . although h. res. 5 includes these provisions , i oppose its grant of legislative jurisdiction to the new committee of areas that have previously been the jurisdiction of other committees . i oppose this grant of jurisdiction , not because of some desire to protect existing committees ' `` turf '' , but because transfer of these security issues to a new committee divests from the responsibility for those issues from those members who have substantial experience and expertise -- in some cases developed through decades of work -- on them . the existing committees are best equipped to give the full house the benefit of carefully thought out recommendations that provide effective security without unnecessary risks to safety or economic efficiency . it will take years for a new committee to be able to develop the expertise to provide the house and the nation with reports and recommendations of the quality that existing committees provide . it is not enough to say that members with particular areas of expertise will have an opportunity to be heard on these issues . the most effective way to influence policy is to be part of the debate and discussion in the early stages of policy formation ; simply voting yes or no when legislation makes it to the house floor is generally not sufficient participation to craft policy . i take this position on the basis of my 30 years of experience in the house , during which time i have given high priority to security , particularly the security of our transportation system . h. res. 5 would divest responsibility for dhs ' transportation and port security functions from the transportation and infrastructure committee , t & amp ; i committee , and transfer it to the homeland security committee . however , transportation and port security can not be considered in a vacuum . developing sound security legislation requires balancing security risks against the economic and safety impacts of such measures on transportation industries and their customers . for example , we would not want to install technology on aircraft to protect against missile attacks if that technology would create disproportionate safety risks . in addition , security mandates are only one type of requirement imposed on transportation industries . other requirements include safety , consumer protection , environmental , accessibility , and competitiveness statutory or regulatory mandates . any security legislation or regulation must be considered in the context of the costs and benefits of all such requirements governing transportation industries . the committee on transportation and infrastructure has the responsibility and the expertise to broadly consider security risks , weigh all costs and benefits of proposed requirements , and determine the likely effects of such actions on transportation industries , their customers , and the existing framework of other statutory and regulatory requirements . the t & amp ; i committee , time and again , has proven it 's capable to ensure that the u.s. transportation system is efficient and safe , as well as secure . in the aftermath of the pan am flight 103 tragedy , the t & amp ; i committee developed the landmark aviation security improvement act of 1990 ( p.l . 101-604 ) , which mandated background checks for airline and airport employees and the deployment of bomb detection equipment for baggage at our nation 's airports . during the 1990s , our committee continued to respond to the changing security needs through oversight and legislation . in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks , the t & amp ; i committee developed and considered the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 , atsa . atsa established a new transportation security administration , tsa , federalized the screening workforce , and required the screening of all checked baggage to protect against terrorist threats . the aviation subcommittee alone has held 19 hearings on aviation security issues since september 11 . since september 11 , the t & amp ; i committee has also spearheaded important maritime and port security legislation including the maritime transportation security act of 2002 , and the coast guard and maritime transportation act of 2004 . the t & amp ; i committee has the member expertise , the staff , and the institutional memory to deal with these issues . i believe that the quality of congressional oversight and legislation on these issues will suffer if these issues are simply transferred wholesale to a new committee . it will take years for the new committee to develop the institutional background and expertise that currently resides in our committee . finally , the republican conference drafted these changes to rule x in isolation . democrats were afforded no role in crafting this critical security policy . i believe the proposed changes to rule x do not further the security of this nation . instead , i fear that they will hamper security by divesting from those members with the experience and institutional knowledge of these issues the direct responsibility to craft security policy . for all of these reasons , i oppose h. res. 5 . ",D
"mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to what i consider a shameless rules package which will undermine the ethical standards held by this house . after the elections in november , the first thing the republican majority did was to lower the house 's ethical standard . in an act of unprecedented shamelessness , they changed the rule of their party to permit an indicted member of their party to remain in a leadership position . yesterday , in the face of an overwhelming bipartisan and public condemnation they changed their rules back . this is not shocking . what is shocking is that they ever considered it in the first place . even more shocking , just if you think you have seen it all , is that the majority considered deleting the most fundamental of ethics rules which says that members of the house should be held to the highest standards of ethical conduct . it says a member shall conduct himself at all times in a manner that should reflect creditably on the house of representatives . dropping this rule is unthinkable . yet republicans only decided to keep it last night when the issue became too hot for them to handle . thank heavens it became too hot for them to handle , but what is completely apparent to the public and those who follow the congress is that the republicans did not leave it at that . they went on to make new mistakes , to undermine the ethical standard of the house . instead of a bipartisan effort to strengthen the ethical process , the republicans have engaged in a completely partisan exercise that should be an affront to every member on either side of the aisle who has served in this body . the proposed changes which are still in this rules package are destructive , and they are unethical . mr. speaker , i know of what i speak . i served on the committee on standards of official conduct for 6 years , and then for a seventh year i served as a part of the bipartisan committee to rewrite the ethics rules . it is bipartisan , evenly divided , and we came up with new ethics rules , some of which survived the floor that year in 1997 . the package that was put together was meant to be fair to members as well as uphold the high ethical standards . it says that members should be judged by their actions and by the rules of the house and the law . so it was only about what took place , the facts and the law . it was not about rumor . it was not about hearsay . it was about the facts , the rules of the house and the law . there was a process which was fair to members because , as i say , as someone who has 7 years on the ethical process , that it is very hard to make judgments about our peers . it is a very , very difficult task , and we want to be fair , but we have a higher responsibility to uphold that ethical standard . so it was put forth and has been the rules of the house and the committee on standards of official conduct that in order to cease or dismiss a case , we had to have a majority of the committee on standards of official conduct . that would be eliminated today . that would be eliminated today . so , on a partisan basis , there could be no cases that go forward . either party with half the votes in the committee , evenly split , could cease and desist any complaints from going forward . that is simply not right . the point of the committee on standards of official conduct is to have a process in which to deal with ethics complaints against members . the point of the committee on standards of official conduct is not to whitewash or to have a system that says nothing will ever move forward . what could the republicans be afraid of that they would so fundamentally undermine the ethical process of the house to say we are going to establish a system where nothing will ever go forward ? this simply is wrong . we owe it to the public , we owe it to each other to uphold that ethical standard . so , as i say , on the first day of this new congress , the republican majority is publicly demonstrating what has been evident for some time , and that is its arrogance , its pettiness , its shortsighted focus on their political life rather than to decide how we are each of us fit to govern . here is the thing . we have this rules package before us . they did some flash last night so that the press is saying , oh , they blinked . they did blink on a couple of different scores , but the fundamental challenge to the ethical standard of the house being enforced is still in this rules package , and it should be rejected . democrats have made two proposals . one of them is to remove this change , and that would be a vote on the previous question , and then on the motion to recommit we address two other abuses of power that should be addressed in this bill . one is what i will call the tauzin rule , and the democratic motion to commit would forbid a member of congress to negotiate with an outside entity that has business before his or her committee and before the congress , in the current congress or in a previous congress , called the tauzin rule because mr. tauzin , who managed the medicare bill , was at the time being courted by the pharmaceutical industry which was to benefit from provisions in the prescription drug bill , a rumored $ 2 million a year salary for selling america 's seniors down the river . that is simply wrong . has this become an auction house ? the public has to think and believe that when we are here and we are on the public payroll and we are members of congress that our accountability is to them and not to our next job . i call that the revolving door , shorthand for the tauzin rule , and the impact of that is a very , very bad prescription drug bill that put pharmaceutical companies first , seniors last . in our motion to commit we also address the 3-day rule . as many of my colleagues recall in recent memory , there was occasion on the floor when a huge bill of many thousands of pages , containing nine appropriations bills , seven of which never appeared on the floor of the united states senate , came before this house where the matter was overnight passed in the committee on rules , came to the floor the next morning without any chance of members being able to read the bill . it came under the martial law rule the republicans use by which they say we waive the 3-day rule by a simple majority . it should take two-thirds , but by a simple majority we waive the 3-day rule . well , why was it important ? it was important that day because there was a great deal in that bill that members did not know about that they were voting on and should not they know that , but very specifically in that bill and it was not found out until the because of the egregiousness of that and the violation of privacy of the american people , i insisted that the members come back to vote on that rather than just have it be done by unanimous consent to remove that provision from the law . why did i call members back ? so that the american people will know because of the abuse of power in this house , ignoring of the 3-day rule , that members can not even see what they are voting on before they vote on it , and something like looking at your tax returns could be sneaked into the bill , without any safeguards to protect people from that . that is just one example . another example is the medicare prescription drug bill which came to the floor without proper time for review as well . the list goes on and on . in our motion to commit , we address the abuse of power of a powerful chairman , negotiating for a job while he was a member of congress , who had control of the bill over the industry , which was offering him $ 2 million a year . that is how much it cost to sell the american seniors down the river , and i hope that even if you separate yourself from any of the examples and just say i sent you to congress to represent me , you do that in what you say there and how you vote , and i expect that you know what you are voting on . the message to the american people here this afternoon is a vote for the motion to commit , is a vote for members to be able to read a bill before they vote on it . is that asking too much ? the republicans say it is . so a yes vote on the motion to commit gives members the 3 days which under the rules of the house they are entitled to . a vote for the motion to commit stops the unethical process of members negotiating with people outside , whose bills they are managing inside this congress , in this congress or in the previous congress . the previous question vote would say no to the republicans in their evisceration of the ethical process of this house by saying that you do not need a majority to dismiss a case ; you can just do it if all the members of your party on the committee decide to stick with you on it . it is simply not right , and this should not be partisan . that is really what is really sad about it . everything that we have done in the ethics process has had some level of respect to the extent that it has because it has been bipartisan , bipartisan in writing the rules , evenly divided committee , cooperation between the chair and ranking member . today is a major departure from that , and i guess maybe i have just spent too many long hours for too many long years in the committee on standards of official conduct room trying to respect the rights of members and our higher responsibility to uphold an ethical standard . to see the republicans today run roughshod , rigging the rules , negotiating for jobs , no reading of the bill , it is an outrage . it is an absolute outrage . so i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the previous question , yes on the motion to commit , and by all means , however you vote on those , no on this very shameful rules package . ",D
"mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . mr. speaker , all over washington and in the country , people are talking today about the majority 's last-minute decision to abandon rules changes that would have eviscerated longstanding ethical guidelines in this house , and , with that , the integrity of the institution . and while in the end the majority was right to withdraw these provisions , they hardly deserve our congratulations . the republicans simply succumbed to tough criticism from every major ethics group in washington , several major news organizations and house democrats . the rules changes in question were so egregious that rank-and-file republicans would not support their leadership 's plan . the proposals were so offensive that the ethics committee chairman broke with his own leadership on the issue . one of the changes would have permitted members , indicted by a grand jury on felony counts , to continue to hold house leadership positions . the measure was similar to a conference rule the house republican conference passed last fall to protect its leadership in the event that one of them is indicted . the fact that they ever considered changing the rules of the house in this disgraceful manner is a sad commentary on the ethical compass of this body 's leadership . they also planned to eliminate a 30-year standing rule that members of congress could be disciplined for actions that brought dishonor and discredit on this house , the people 's house . this standard is similar to the one that exists for the men and women serving in our military . how could they even think about changing the house rules in this regard when to do so would mean demanding a higher ethical standard from an 18-year-old private in the army than we who sit in this hallowed chamber ? how could we ask more from our young people than we ask of ourselves ? it is hard to believe that there was a time in the not too distant past when the republicans touted their high ethical and moral standards . mr. speaker , it seems to me that this entire episode has been a violation of the public trust . when americans enter their voting booths and cast their ballots for congress , they give us a very precious gift , their trust . american voters expect , and rightly so , that we as members of congress will conduct ourselves at the highest ethical standard and uphold democratic principles such as integrity and accountability . how can we as the guardians of democracy spread the values of self-governance across the world if we refuse to govern ourselves right here in this chamber ? mr. speaker , though we should all be relieved that the republicans were shamed into abandoning the most overtly egregious provisions , the remaining ethics provisions in today 's legislation will still destroy the house ethics process . i can not say it more plainly than that . the ethics process will be destroyed . the tactics have changed , but the end result is the same . the house ethics system will be gutted . mr. speaker , the committee on standards of official conduct is the only evenly divided committee in the house . as the rule stands today , if the five republicans and five democrats on the committee do not reach agreement about the merits of an ethics complaint , it is automatically referred to investigators . this approach was designed to take the partisan politics out of the equation and to ensure that meritorious complaints would be investigated regardless of the political winds of the day . under the republican rules package , one-half of the committee will now have the power to bury complaints , even the most meritorious ones . under the rules package before us today , if the committee is deadlocked , the ethics complaint dies . this one provision gives the republicans an enormous amount of control over who is and who is not investigated by the committee on standards of official conduct . in practical terms , the republicans have granted themselves veto power over any complaint it does not deem palatable . mr. speaker , this rules package would effectively eliminate the 45-day deadline the committee on standards of official conduct currently has to act on complaints . the 45-day requirement was designed to prevent ethics complaints from being buried away from public view and to ensure that those members who should be held accountable for corruption would be . this provision ensures that no ethics complaint will move forward against a republican without their leadership 's consent . mr. speaker , we can be sure that if these rules changes had been in place in the last congress , no ethics complaints would have seen the light of day . under the republicans , the ethical climate in washington has eroded enormously . when i speak to constituents , i find myself telling them to forget what they learned in school about how a bill becomes a law . in times past , our laws were written to serve the public interest . but today the sad reality is that corporations like enron write our nation 's policies . the medicare drug bill that was rammed through congress in the dead of night stands as a potent example of the ethical erosion of the house of representatives . when the dust settled on the prescription drug vote , former representative billy tauzin , the key author and then chairman of the committee on energy and commerce , had himself the republican rules package will reduce this committee to a paper tiger . the american people deserve much better than to have a `` for sale '' sign placed on the united states house of representatives . they deserve to be able to trust their elected leaders and have faith in the integrity of this institution . they should be able to expect accountability from their government . unfortunately , the lesson we have here today is if you have the power and you break the rules , you can just change the rules . mr. speaker , i know there are members on the other side of the aisle , because i know them , who care greatly about the integrity of this chamber , and i know that there are freshmen members here today eager to cast their first vote on behalf of the constituents whose trust they hold and the constitution they love . i challenge those new members , and any other republican who values integrity and the sanctity of the democratic process , to stand up for the values of those who trusted you to represent them . mr. speaker , at the close of this debate , i will be asking members to vote `` no '' on the previous question so i can strike from the rules package language that would allow the republicans to run out the clock on serious ethics complaints . immediately following that vote , i will ask for a `` yes '' on a motion to commit the resolution so that we can add two important rules changes . the first would prohibit members from negotiating lucrative job deals that capitalize on their committee membership . the other would guarantee that members have at least 3 days to read a house report before voting on it . when bills are rushed to the floor , cobbled together at the last minute , warm from the machine , pages are missing or , worse , outrageous provisions are slipped in by committee staff . lest we forget , the provision that opened up private taxpayers ' records that was sneaked into last year 's omnibus spending bill was by just such a staff member . mr. speaker , i urge my colleagues to vote to strike the egregious ethics changes in this package . we owe it to the constituents we serve , to this institution , and to the constitution that we adore and revere to restore the ethics and integrity to the people 's house . mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .

"mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from ohio ( mr. oxley ) xz4003070 for his support of the legislation as well as his managing of it here today , and his general goodwill for all people in this country . mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 54 , the congressional gold medal enhancement act of 2005 , and i do urge its immediate adoption after consideration of the amendments today . congress created the congress gold medal honor in 1776 to recognize military leaders , and awarded the first medal to george washington for his heroic service in the revolutionary war , as the chairman indicated earlier . since then , the gold medal has evolved to become the highest civilian honor congress confers to express gratitude for distinguished service , to dramatize the virtues of patriotism , and to perpetuate the remembrance of a great event . the legislation we consider today seeks to maintain the prestige of the medal by limiting the number that may be awarded in any given year . to understand the need for such legislation , a little history of the medal is in order . as i mentioned , the first congressional gold medal was struck in 1776 , in paris , for america had no appropriate facilities at that point , at the behest of the continental congress , which had not yet declared independence from great britain . the recipient was general george washington , and the act that inspired the medal was his leadership of the continental army in driving the british from boston . in the next dozen years , congress awarded six more gold medals to individuals for heroic action in the revolutionary war . that is an average of one medal every congress . by comparison , in the 108th congress we authorized five medal programs honoring seven individuals and one couple . in the 106th congress we authorized seven medal programs , but because of multiple recipients , the number of medals totaled more than 300 . mr. chairman , all of those medals were deserved , and i supported their authorization . my concern , and a concern shared by many members , is that the luster and the importance and the meaning of a congressional gold medal will be tarnished if we do not limit the number we award . reversing this trend will protect the medal 's prestige . mr. chairman , this is a simple piece of legislation with great meaning . it will ensure the future integrity and true honor of the award . it is my goal that each recipient , president , civil rights leader , military hero , inventor , or noted healer , who receives the congressional gold medal will remain part of a unique honor bestowed by the united states congress . as you may recall , mr. chairman , we had a similar problem a decade ago with commemorative coins . while commemorative coins are not as prestigious as congressional gold medals , both are used to recognize moments in history . these coins have also helped raise money through surcharges for a worthy cause . a decade ago , the commemorative coin program had gotten out of control , with many coin programs approved each year , and many of the programs costing taxpayers money . one blatant example is the 1996 olympics coin program that the gao estimates cost taxpayers $ 26 million . in response , mr. chairman , i authored and congress approved the commemorative reform coin act . now coin programs are limited to two a year and demand full cost recovery for taxpayers before any surcharges are paid . additionally , before congress can consider a coin or medal program , two-thirds of the house , 290 members , must cosponsor the legislation to demonstrate broad bipartisan support . and having done that , i can tell you it takes broad bipartisan support to get the 290 members . i believe that the reforms to the commemorative coin program have been extraordinarily successful . since these reforms were enacted in the 104th congress , commemorative coins have not cost the taxpayers a dime . instead , the programs have raised millions for worthy causes , provided valuable collections , and , importantly , restored prestige to commemorative coins . but something disturbing happened when we reformed the commemorative coin program . the number of congressional gold medals saw a dramatic increase . from 1776 , when congress created the medal , to 1904 , congress approved 47 medals . in the last 100 years , congress awarded 86 medals , including 20 in the past decade , since the commemorative coin reforms . and this number jumped even higher , over 300 , when including multiple recipients for each medal . mr. chairman , over the years , congressional gold medals have gone to the reverend dr . martin luther king , jr. , rosa parks , jackie robinson , mother teresa , elie wiesel , pope john paul ii , british prime ministers winston churchill and tony blair , jonas salk , john wayne , and robert f. kennedy , among others . reading the list of all the medal recipients and the deeds that earned the medal is quite inspiring . to maintain these medals as the highest of honors , the legislation before us would limit the number of medals that may be awarded to two a year , and clarify that recipients are individuals and not groups . i understand there is concern by the minority that one bill per year should be designated for each party . i feel it is important to note that proposals in the past have been sponsored in about equal numbers by republicans and democrats , and i do not really recall any discussion of the recipients ' or the sponsors ' party affiliations . in my view , any such discussion would be inappropriate , as these awards should be awarded in true bipartisan fashion . in practice , however , not through statute , the committee on financial services requires a two-thirds cosponsorship before considering proposals to award medals , a practice that the senate has now adopted . i believe by the adoption of these simple changes , we can preserve the prestige and the integrity of the congressional gold medal program , something i believe all members support . i encourage my colleagues to join me in maintaining the integrity of the congressional gold medal by supporting this measure . i urge immediate and unanimous passage of h.r. 54 with no amendments but the manager 's amendment . ",R
"mr. chairman , will the gentleman yield ? ",R
"i thank the gentleman for yielding . mr. chairman , not to prolong the discussion , because i think the gentleman from new york is making some very valid points that should be debated , one of them which is an amendment which is not included here today , and that is the issue of the groups . we have checked the history of this . to the best of my knowledge , and the gentleman may have some different evidence , i do not think it is different because it is fairly clear who has received these medals , it has always been individuals historically . it was never couples . that is only something that has happened in the more recent couple of decades , perhaps a couple of times . as far as the groups are concerned , there have only been three altogether . certainly i am not suggesting any of them are not deserving , for goodness sake . they all are . the navajo code talkers clearly are deserving . that obviously created some problems because of the volume of the medals , and it was done in sort of an unusual procedure . the red cross is another very deserving , and so are the veterans of the civil war , which is the other group we found , although that was done much after the civil war . there are all kinds of groups out there . the congressional gold medal of honor has always been bestowed upon an individual in a very special ceremony to honor that individual . it is not easy to get done . i do not know if the gentleman has done it . as i said before , i did it . it is difficult to get 290 signatures on anything around here . so it is difficult to get done . so obviously it is going to be somebody who is deserving . it is going to be as bipartisan as could be . you can not do it with one party or the other . you have got to get everybody . that is what the history of it is . we tried to develop this legislation to have a great recognition of what we consider to be the greatest honor this congress can give to a limited number of individuals , which was always what the intent of it was . there are a whole lot of ways of recognizing groups . you and i could sit here and name groups for hours at a time that could be honored . but the congressional gold medal was never really created for that purpose . that is the intent of what we are trying to do in the legislation . i just wanted to make that point in the history of it . ",R
"mr. chairman , if the gentleman will yield further , i do not mean to reiterate or repeat too much . looking at the history of these congressional gold medals , though , i think is very telling in terms of what we are doing because the history has always been to individuals for outstanding achievement . so in terms of the groups , i really think we should honor that . that is not disrespectful of any group that has gotten it or all the other groups who are potentially eligible out there if you use them in that criteria of measurement . but the other issue is interesting , and that is how many of these should we be able to have ? first of all , the history of the gold medal has been very bipartisan . i think , as we all know , when we are dealing with that many signatures , it is going to be bipartisan . there is no question about that . but my sense is that the two a year is not as limiting as one might think when you really again look at the history of this . in fact , if anything , it would be an expansion over what the total history of it has been . by the time you go through a legislative session and you gather 290 signatures and you go through committee and you go to the floor , and i have handled these bills , they often happen the last day , by the way , so it is always very confusing in terms of what we are doing , i think you are going to find this is not as limiting as one might think . again , i recognize the fact that it is a bigger country , that there is much more going on in the country and that kind of thing , but we are really trying to make sure that this is truly an honor for somebody who does something extraordinary in science or the arts , or an elected official or somebody of that nature , usually a president , i think the only elected official who has ever been honored ; people in religion , people who have just absolutely stood out in their circumstances . my sense is while we can argue here on the floor that it is limiting , i think the bottom line is it is not going to end up being as limiting as one might think . hopefully it would not be . obviously if that happened to be the case , it is something that could always be revisited , but i just do not think it is going to be the case . i believe that straightening this out is actually going to make these gold medals much more of a distinction than perhaps they would be if we allowed this to continue , particularly with the commemorative coin changes , increasing the pressure to try to do so many of these . ",R
"mr. chairman , i will be brief . first of all , this is not a killer amendment . this is not an unreasonable amendment , and the sponsor has certainly always been a very reasonable member of congress , and we are arguing at the margins here in terms of what we are doing , and i recognize that . and i recognize these arguments because they are compelling to a degree . having said all those things , i still oppose it . and let me explain why . it is not a lot different from what i have already said , mr. chairman , and that is essentially we are trying to make this a medal of true distinction for true heroes of the united states of america . i also believe , by the way , and the gentleman from new york ( mr. crowley ) xz4000870 said something i thought was interesting , and that is it is difficult to get the names on the legislation . so the first year becomes a little more difficult , and that is true . we sort of learn techniques in this when we have done it . one is we take it to conferences or big gatherings of people and pass it out that way . the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. payne ) xz4003120 will always be a hero in my mind because he took it amongst the democrats and got a lot of signatures when i was struggling with it on a bill that i did last year , and i appreciate that a great deal . but i have learned when one really applies oneself , they can do it reasonably rapidly ; and hopefully the committees will be able to be responsive to it and will be able to do two a year if that is what we decide to do . but my judgment is four in total in the course of 2 years is sufficient . and i am worried about the influx that is going on . the chairman cited the numbers . i do not remember the exact numbers . it was something like 45 medals in the first 120 years and now 10 times that many in the last 10 years . that means that this has increased , i think , at a rate that is too rapid , and again i do not in any way belittle anyone who has received this because they are all very distinguished people . but having said that , we want this to be the highest honor possible . so my judgment is we should defeat the amendment . if at some point it proves we need to expand this , we would certainly consider that . but i think we should try to restore this program to where it was before . ",R
"mr. chairman , i made a couple of these points before , and again i will not repeat too much here , but first and foremost is the 290 signatures . i do not know if one party is ever going to have 290 members or not , i sort of doubt it , at least in the time most of us are around here , and you need both parties in order do this . i learned with the coin that i did , which was benjamin franklin . i can not tell you , and hardly anyone can tell you , whether benjamin franklin was or would have been a republican or a democrat in his history . we do not know the politics of people like george washington , and certainly the people who have been from other countries , a number of individuals who received medals here in the congress of the united states . in the history of the gold medals , as i believe the gentleman from new york ( mr. crowley ) xz4000870 pointed out , it has been as much democrats , even more so than republicans . even on the business of the commemorative coins , a number of the sponsors in the senate have been democrats as well . i just have never noticed a lot of politics in this , i guess is my point . it seems to me i have been asked to sign these , and i generally sign them , unless it is something i think is spurious , by democrats and republicans . i do not think about it . certainly , if a party feels it is being slighted , they can say we are just not going to sign on to something . i do not think this needs a political balance . what it really needs , i think , is to find out , if we are going to do two , who the two most distinguished individuals are who should be recognized and go ahead and recognize them , apart from whatever the politics may be . i do not think it is going to fall down along political lines . so i do rise in opposition to this . i just think it is sort of a necessary strain on having a political balance on something which is not essential . ",R
i yield to the gentleman from new york . ,R
"mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , and i will be glad to yield further in a moment , it typically has not worked that way . typically , the way you do it is , somebody comes to you with the idea , maybe it is a thomas edison or somebody of that ilk , of that nature , and you generally will then go to your leadership or to the leadership on the other side or to the chairman of the committee and say , look , i am interested in getting this done . if i am going to go out and get the 290 signatures , i want some idea that it is going to be considered . i would be dumbfounded if you had five on one side and five on the other . in fact , i would be dumbfounded if you had two on one side and two on the other . you generally sort of pre-clear it ; and , generally speaking , politics has just not entered into it . before you go through all that effort and work , you want to get a pretty good idea that the bill is going to be able to get at least through the house . then , by the way , getting it through the senate is another whole other issue that you have to deal with as well . so , typically , we have not had a surplus of these . generally speaking , when we have gotten to the 290 , it has already been pretty well agreed upon by leadership . as the gentleman knows , on commemorative coins , they can be done in out years . we are doing coins already for 2007 and years beyond that , i believe , at this point . but almost always you work it out in advance . as the gentleman knows from our committee work , i do not know of any time where we have actually had to pick and choose at the committee on these coins . it is almost always worked out in advance and agreed upon . mr. chairman , i truly do not worry about this from a political point of view . i really do not think this is a necessary amendment to deal with that , based on what i have seen . i do not think limiting it to two is going to change that at all . i certainly would support the best people , which is what we are trying to do . frankly , most of these bills , while there may be a democrat sponsor or a republican sponsor , almost always has a cosponsor from the other side . you can not really do it without sponsors from both sides . so there is much more bipartisanship in this process than almost anything i know about in this congress . ",R
"mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , technically , as the gentleman and i both know , we have seen a lot , the majority is always going to control ultimately what is going to happen on the floor . it will go through the committee and go to the floor . i still go back to a whole history . i have been here for 12 years . i have watched these medals . i have never seen a bit of politics in these medals . i just have not seen it . i do not think the limiting of the numbers is really going to alter that . i think a large part now is because you need all those signatures , you just can not do it in a partisan sense . so i do not think this amendment is necessary . i think it brings in an element of politics that frankly we just do not have in the legislation . so i will oppose it . i understand the gentleman 's arguments , but i would oppose the amendment . ",R
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . mr. chairman , i would like to express my disappointment that this legislation is not being offered under an open rule . in fact , the chairman of the full committee on financial services , the gentleman from ohio ( mr. oxley ) xz4003070 , who holds jurisdiction over this legislation , even requested during his committee on rules testimony last night a more open process for debate on this bill , and i thank the chairman for those comments . i would also like to take a moment to specifically thank and welcome our new committee on rules ranking member , my friend and colleague , the gentlewoman from new york ( ms. slaughter ) xz4003780 , who will serve as a true and tireless fighter for democrats and our rights in the minority on the committee on rules over the next 2 years . mr. chairman , the bill we are debating today , h.r. 54 , the congressional gold medal enhancement act of 2005 , while introduced in the previous congress , was never debated in committee because no hearings were convened , and no markup was held . and given that the committee on financial services has yet to even hold its organizational meeting for the 109th congress , the committee has obviously not yet had an opportunity to consider this issue carefully . in my view , we are rushing to act on an issue that does not represent a problem . having said that , democrats are open to debating and voting on this legislation . in the last several congresses , congressional gold medals have been considered in the house under a well-established and a bipartisan process that works well . regular order for consideration of gold medals involves the need , under the rules of the committee on financial services , to gain the cosponsorship of two-thirds of the house before the legislation is considered in committee , a full two-thirds sponsorship of the house before it is considered in committee . the bar for consideration for gold medals is set relatively high for a reason : gaining a two-thirds cosponsorship ensures that a solid bipartisan majority of the house is in full support of honoring a particularly noteworthy individual or individuals . under the rule today , i plan to offer two amendments . the first amendment would raise the number of gold medals from two per calendar year to six per congress , or an overall increase of two medals per congress . this is especially key , as in the 108th congress we awarded five congressional gold medals . they went to tony blair , the prime minister of great britain ; dr . dorothy height , president of the national council of negro women ; jackie robinson , the first black player in major league baseball ; the reverend dr . martin luther king , posthumously , and his widow coretta scott king , the civil rights icons ; and the posthumous awarding to reverend joseph a. delaine , harry and eliza briggs , and levi pearson , the leaders in our nation 's efforts to desegregate public schools that led directly to the case brown et al . v. the board of education of topeka . my second amendment would provide for equitable distribution of gold medals between the majority and the minority . my amendments seek to maintain the spirit and process of bipartisanship that has characterized the house 's consideration of gold medals , the highest honor that this congress can bestow on an individual or group of individuals . it is my hope that the house will adopt these amendments to make this bill a better bill . stating that , though , i am dismayed that the committee on rules refused to allow consideration of a key amendment that would strike a section of the bill that only permits the granting of congressional gold medals to individuals . while i tend to agree with the notion that distributing what is an exceptional honor to too many individuals could devalue the symbolic worth of a gold medal , there are occasions when more than one person is justified to receive the medal for their honorable actions in tandem with others . in the last congress , we enacted into law legislation awarding the congressional gold medal posthumously , as i mentioned before , to reverend joseph a. delaine , harry and eliza briggs , and levi pearson in recognition of their contributions to the nation as pioneers in the effort to desegregate public schools that led directly to the landmark desegregation case of brown v. the board of ed . in previous congresses , the house has awarded gold medals to other groups , such as native american code talkers , who were critical to the safety of allied communications during world war ii ; to the little rock nine , the civil rights pioneers who led to the integration of our public schools ; and to ronald and nancy reagan , in honor of their contribution to our country . i fear that limiting gold medals to only individuals would also limit certain people from consideration who are most deserving of receiving one of our nation 's highest honors . for example , my good friend and republican colleague , the gentleman from new york ( mr. king ) xz4002202 offered an amendment in the previous congress , which the house passed , to honor the officers , emergency workers , and other employees of the federal government and any state or local government , including any interstate governmental entity , who responded to the attacks on the world trade center in new york city and who perished in that attack on september 11 with a congressional gold medal . this would not be possible if this bill passed . and i would hope that my friend , the gentleman from new york ( mr. king ) xz4002202 , will oppose this bill , because if it were to pass , it would put an end to any opportunity to present the congressional gold medal to any of those heroes . again , while i urge my colleagues to support my two amendments that were made in order , i am dismayed that this third amendment was not made in order . if this bill were already law , congress would not have been able to issue the congressional medal of honor to the little rock nine or to the reagans . i feel this is a serious oversight in the base of this bill . mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from texas ( ms. jackson-lee ) xz4001990 . ",D
"mr. chairman , will the gentlewoman yield ? ",D
"mr. chairman , an amendment was offered yesterday evening before the committee on rules that would have asked groups as well as individuals . we struck a portion of the language dealing with limiting this only to individuals . i would have asked , if that amendment had passed , would have enlarged the pool to groups as well . that was not passed in the committee on rules , and therefore we are here today working a bill that does not have that provision in it . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . in listening to the sponsor in terms of the need for this legislation , one could intimate by the introduction that possibly medals were given out in a haphazard manner . i mentioned before it takes two-thirds of the members of the house , the entire body , to introduce a gold medal for its consideration in the committee on financial services , a bar that i believe is a very , very high bar and one that is not easily attained . i would also point out that limiting this to individuals , and again to reiterate , martin luther king and coretta scott king were both issued the gold medal . they would not have gotten that medal under this legislation . harry and eliza briggs , levi pearson , and reverend joseph armstrong delaine were all issued the medal in one provision . as mentioned before , nancy reagan , along with president reagan , would not have been eligible . under the provisions today , they would have to get it individually . betty and gerald ford , the little rock nine , and dr . graham and ruth graham would not have received it either . i think therein lies a tremendous flaw . it also intimates that there may be too many of these gold medals given out . who that received this medal in the past was not worthy of it ? was it dr . martin luther king and coretta scott king ; was it reverend delaine , harry and eliza briggs , and levi pearson ; was it jackie robinson ; was it dorothy height ; tony blair in the last congress ? in the 106th congress was it nancy reagan ; was it pope john paul , ii ; was it charles schulz , the great cartoonist ? was it rosa parks ? who amongst those was not qualified , who do we believe was not deserving of this medal . therein lies the flaw in this bill . it actually limits us from giving to those who i believe are most deserving of recognition of this gold medal . ",D
"mr. chairman , will the gentleman yield ? ",D
"mr. chairman , would it be safe to say under regular order if this legislation were passed that the code talkers , under regular order , and that was an extraordinary provision made in the appropriations process , under regular order would they be eligible to receive this medal in the future if this bill were to pass ? ",D
"mr. chairman , if the gentleman will continue to yield , that is the point i am trying to make . to say that the code talkers , and i am not saying the gentleman is suggesting this , but to suggest that they did not deserve the ultimate award , even as a group , for what they provided to the service of this country during world war ii is just ridiculous . they certainly deserved as a group . any one individual , no . there were multiple individuals who provided an incredible service to us . i would also point out that two is not individual . two individuals makes up a group , to my understanding , and that would include nancy and ronald reagan . that would include any husband and wife , including dr . king and coretta scott king . that would preclude them from getting this medal in the future . that is my understanding of the legislation before us . ",D
"mr. chairman , i want to recognize the significance of this medal , that it is not given out willy-nilly ; that , as i mentioned before , it takes extraordinary measures to get enough support to get this medal passed . i recognize that the first person who received this medal was general george washington , prior to him becoming president of the united states , when the country was brand new , when we did not have the richness of diversity and of events that have taken place throughout the history of our country ever since this first medal was given to george washington ; that we have grown as a nation , in size and in stature ; and that there have been many events that have occurred throughout our history since the striking of the first medal that have inured greatly to the advancement of our country that from time to time need to be recognized . that is what this medal gives an opportunity to do , both to individuals and to groups . certainly general washington was an incredible individual , someone who was deserving of the first medal that was ever produced , and i think he accepted that on behalf of all those men and women who fought for independence from great britain back during the war of independence . but certainly we have grown in size , both in states , from thirteen colonies and states to 50 states , and the number of people in this country have grown incredibly since the founding of this nation , and the events that have occurred throughout our history has certainly changed the shape of the distribution of this medal as well . i think that needs to be recognized and taken into consideration . i thank the gentleman for yielding . ",D
"if the gentleman will yield further , let me just make a point . i appreciate what the gentleman from delaware has said . the reality is , though , a country of 300 million people , only 20 medals have been awarded in the past decade . that is not an awful lot of medals . the point that the gentleman is making is that it has been extraordinary when we have actually issued this medal to groups . why are we now limiting ourselves ; when it is extraordinary , recognized as extraordinary , why are we now officially and legally limiting the ability of congress to issue this medal to groups ? i do not understand that . we understand the process is hard . the gentleman has just said himself to get two-thirds of the members of this house truly requires bipartisanship to get this done . this is not done , as i mentioned before , in a willy-nilly manner . there is great effort involved . i understand it . i remember when my friend from new york ( mr. fossella ) xz4001390 was doing this for john cardinal o'connor and the effort that it took to get both sides to get enough members to sign onto that . i do understand the difficulties in that , but i hope the gentleman understands the appreciation that has been set forth by my testimony here today as well as my good friend from texas ( ms. jackson-lee ) xz4001990 that sometimes , not ofttimes , it is not just individuals , but it is groups who are responsible for incredible , incredible events in this country and i believe are deserving of the congressional gold medal . i hope that the gentleman would agree with that and we will have a motion to recommit that will , if passed , put this back to committee and will strike that language limiting it only to individuals . ",D
"not to prolong the debate , either , because i know we want to move on , but since 1999 when we passed the coin act , there have been some concerns on our side of the aisle . i know that one of the amendments your side has accepted , or that was accepted in the rules committee , it remains to be seen whether it passes or not , that would evenly divide the number of gold medals , that did not exist in the coin bill that passed . overwhelmingly it has been one side . in terms of bipartisanship , it has not been very bipartisan in terms of coins that have been established . according to our records , 15 out of the 16 coin bills that were passed were sponsored by republicans . i do not think that is just going to happen under this legislation . that is also , i think , some of the fear in terms of changing the rules , for lack of a better word , on the gold medal has stirred up consternation on our side of the aisle . i offer that as well . i recognize that the minting of a coin is a way that we can bring recognition to individuals and to groups . i just do not think that we should be limiting ourselves as the house of representatives and as a congress in reducing our leverage or our ability to honor groups of individuals who have done incredible , incredible works on behalf of this nation . i think that is what that provision of the bill will actually end up doing is limiting , tying our hands from honoring groups in the form of the congressional gold medal . that is why i stand in opposition to that . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . something that is not often highlighted outside the hall is that there are actually friendships between democrats and republicans , and mr. oxley xz4003070 and i share that . i would like to point out for the record though that he is extremely partisan when it comes to congressional baseball , and i hope that next year he gives the democrats an opportunity to have a win . having said that , i have no objections to this amendment . mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself as much time as i may consume . this amendment is a simple and fair amendment that would increase the maximum number of congressional gold medals that congress could award from two per calendar year to six per congress , an increase of two medals per congress . the reason for this amendment was best summed up by the republican rules committee member , the gentleman from georgia ( mr. gingrey ) xz4001510 last night during his questioning of chairman oxley . he had concerns that the bill in its current form would make members hesitate before introducing their own congressional gold medal bills until late in the first year , waiting to see if others had more noteworthy recipients , then late in the first year rushing to introduce i too share some of those concerns and believe we can address this by passing this amendment . this would allow for the passage of six medals over the life of a congress instead of two per year over the life of a calendar year . i believe that members on both sides would prefer the flexibility of having more rather than fewer possibilities to award gold medals to citizens who deserve to be bestowed with one of our nation 's highest honors . but this higher number does not cheapen the medal because of the high threshold needed for consideration , two-thirds of the chamber . foolish medal bills will not attract the support that they would need for consideration . finally , this amendment is needed in the most practical purpose yet . in the last congress we awarded five congressional gold medals . they went to tony blair , prime minister of great britain , dr . dorothy height , president of the national council of negro women , jackie robinson , the first black player in major league baseball , reverend dr . martin luther king , jr. , posthumously and his wife coretta scott king , the civil rights icons , and posthumously awarded to the reverend joseph a. delaine , harry and eliza briggs , and levi pearson , the leaders in our nation 's efforts to desegregate public schools that led directly to the case of brown versus the board of ed . additionally , we granted six medals in the 106th congress and six in the 105th congress . in the 106th congress we passed into law three democratic sponsored bills and three republican sponsored bills . they went to ronald and nancy reagan , pope john paul ii , charles schulz , john cardinal o'connor , theodore hesburgh , rosa parks . and in the 105th congress two democratic sponsored bills and four republican sponsored bills for medals became law . gerald and betty ford , the little rock 9 , nelson mandela , to the patriarch bartholomew , to mother teresa of calcutta and to frank sinatra , introduced by my colleague , the gentleman from new york ( mr. serrano ) xz4003660 . this amendment is about flexibility for members , the ability to debate and consider legislation over the entire congress just as we do with every other piece of legislation . it will not cheapen but rather enhance this most prestigious of american honors . in fact , the existing committee on financial services rule requiring two-thirds cosponsorship of the house for a gold medal , which by definition represents broad-based bipartisan support , prevents the awarding of frivolous and undeserved medals to groups of individuals . i trust that two-thirds of the house represents a solid bipartisan consensus of the will of the house and therefore believe that this acts as a check on any effort to award medals to any groups of individuals who in the opinion of the house do not deserve such award . i urge the acceptance of this amendment . mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .

"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . i am disappointed that the chairman will not support this amendment . i think it is a reasonable amendment , one that i do not think in any way disrupts what the intention of the bill by the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 , the sponsor , is , that is , to limit the number . we certainly are limiting the number in this amendment to six as opposed to what the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 would do per calendar year , which would be four . we are still limiting it to six . i think in the most recent history , we have not done more than six within a congress . this again will help to free the hands of members to introduce gold medal legislation for people who they believe are worthy of that great honor . i would just like to point out again that the founding fathers in their wisdom did not have as many people that they had to honor during that time . we have grown more than tenfold since the founding of this nation . there have been many more events that have taken place since the founding fathers initially granted those initial gold medals , and i think that once again if we do not pass this , we will further be limiting our ability to ensure that those who are most deserving will receive this great honor . mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . mr. chairman , the sponsor made compelling arguments that the amendment is reasonable . therefore , one would conclude that if it is reasonable and compelling arguments are made that there would be bipartisan support for the amendment . unfortunately , that is not going to be the case . i hope that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle , though , do recognize that not only are there compelling arguments , that they are reasonable and that it is a reasonable amendment and therefore deserves to be voted in favor of . and i hope that my colleagues on the other side as well as my side of the aisle view it the same way . mr. chairman i yield back the balance of my time . ",D
"mr. chairman , i demand a recorded vote , and pending that , i make the point of order that a quorum is not present . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . i hope that this amendment would also be received as reasonable and with cogent arguments . my second amendment made in order under the rule would allow for the equitable distribution of these medals between the majority and the minority . since the 104th congress , 24 gold medal resolutions became law . using the process currently in place that has worked so well for us , the two parties in the house have evenly split sponsorship of these medals . republican members have sponsored 10 medals and democratic members have also sponsored 10 medals . in fact , this amendment probably makes more sense with republican support in it than democrats , as in the 108th congress , five congressional medals were awarded and four of those were sponsored by democrats , only one by a republican . but i offer this amendment out of basic fairness for both sides . i , therefore , believe if we are to limit the number of gold medals and if we are to obtain the bipartisanship that has characterized the process , my amendment should be passed by the chamber , my fear being that if we limit it to only four , then leadership will decide who will sponsor those four , and we in the minority may find ourselves on the short end of that stick . and that is why i offer this amendment . i hope that the members will agree to accept this amendment . mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . i appreciate the comments of my colleague , the chairman of the committee . just to add that , yes , we do work in a very bipartisan way . if the chairman and i were making decisions as to who would receive the gold medal , i think we would work it out amongst ourselves to make sure that it was done in a very bipartisan way . that , unfortunately , has not been the history of the house , and i just point out , for instance , as i mentioned earlier , back when we created the commemorative coin legislation in 1999 , out of the 16 coins that have been created , 15 have been introduced by republican members , only one by the minority . the majority has had 15 of the 16 . the minority has had one . i do not think that is a very fair and balanced way in which we can collectively and bipartisanly recognize those who have made tremendous sacrifices or achievements or contributed to this country . and i believe that we are limiting it to , in this case , this legislation , if passed the way it does , four congressional gold medals that we in the minority may very well find ourselves in a very difficult position in that we may not have any of our honorees awarded the medal even though we go through the process of collecting the two-thirds . it then becomes a political decision as to which honorees will get the gold medal in that particular year and which will not . for instance , if there are 16 individuals who are sponsored by members of the house and those individuals get two-thirds of the signatures required , which of the 16 will get the four medals ? which of those 16 ? that decision will be made based on a political decision that is made within the house , and i dare say that outside influence would also come to bear on that decision that was made as well . that is why i am asking for this fair and balanced approach ; that if we are going to limit it to just four , that it will be two per year . i do not think it is unreasonable to ask that it is done in this way . quite frankly , if there is someone that the democratic side of the aisle , if we have used up our one per year and we have another extraordinary person , i think we can work with each other to ask a republican member of the house to sponsor that bill . and vice versa . if we somehow find we have run out of opportunities on our side to introduce legislation , i do not think it is unusual to ask a member of the other side of the aisle to sponsor the bill . that is the spirit in which i think we can work in a bipartisan way to ensure that every person who receives this gold medal , besides getting a two-thirds vote , it is done in a bipartisan way . i do not think this is frivolous , and i do not think this trivial . that is why i offered the amendment , and i hope we pass it . ",D
"mr. chairman , i appreciate the gentleman 's comments . i know that the gentleman does not approach this in any other fashion but a bipartisan fashion . but the question i have is if we are going to limit this to two per year , it could be that five members on our side of the aisle have five individuals they want to recognize . there could be five individuals on the republican side of the aisle who have five individuals they want to recognize . that is 10 people , 10 bills , 10 instances where members have garnered two-thirds . who then will decide who gets the medals ? it then becomes a very political decision as to who gets each of the medals . will it be the five on the majority side ? will it be two from the majority side ? will it be two from the minority side ? will it be one each ? who of the 10 deserving will get it , and who will not get it ? ",D
"mr. chairman , if the gentleman will yield further , the rules will have changed once we pass this bill , whereas right now it is unlimited . granted , where it is unlimited , there has not been this rush to introduce bills . as the gentleman mentioned before , this is not done in a very quick fashion . this is done in a bipartisan way . but when we limit it to two per year , we are putting a cap on it , i think we can in the future find ourselves in a situation where , all right maybe five on each side is a little much , maybe two on each side . then which of the four ? who makes that decision as to which of the four gets the medal ? and therein lies the politics . unfortunately , i think you are creating more politics in this bill . i do not think that is your intent . i think you are doing this because you want to enrich the value of the gold medal . i understand that . but i think inherently by the changes being proposed , you are bringing more politics into the decisionmaking as to who obtains this medal . that is what i am trying to in a sense , avoid by evenly dividing between democrat and republican , majority , minority , the ability for both sides to equally participate in this process . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . unfortunately , i think that in the past there may have been some politics involved . i understand that one of my colleagues on this side had achieved the requisite number of signatures for a commemorative gold medal for the columbia 107 in the last congress , in the middle of the last congress , and that was never awarded . so i do not know why . i do not know if there was any reason for that , when the requisite number of signatures were given , that that bill was not taken up in the committee and that member was not successful in getting that award to the columbia 107 . why that was not done , i do not know . i do not know if politics was part of that . maybe someone can answer that question . but therein lies the problem , that from time to time , quite possibly there is politics involved as to why some individuals receive the gold medals and others do not . mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . mr. chairman , i appreciate my colleague on the other side . it is the pay grade issue i am concerned about , as the gentleman mentioned , as to who makes these decisions and as to why some individuals are successful in garnering a gold medal for an individual or group , and maybe another is not . there is some political judgment that is made as well , i believe . as the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 said , there is a process that will begin after this legislation is passed , nuances that members will work through . i would just offer , if this amendment were to pass , they would work through these nuances . as i mentioned before , if two gold medals were enacted into law by democrats and i had a third that i wanted to get passed , i would go to the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 and say , mike , we do not have any more room on our side . here is an opportunity ; someone is deserving . would you consider sponsoring this and passing it ? i think , quite frankly , if there was a compelling argument , the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 would say , certainly , joe crowley . we will do it . that is a nuance to work through as well in terms of working in a bipartisan way . this simply ensures that both republicans and democrats are working in a bipartisan way , beyond the two-thirds vote ; that medals are not being used for political purposes , but are being given because the individuals deserve them . that is what we are trying to do with this amendment . mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . ",D
"yes , i am opposed to the bill in its current form . ",D
"mr. speaker , today we begin the 109th congress in earnest , and we do so by considering a bill that we do not need to act on for a problem that , in our view and in the view of many of my colleagues , simply does not exist . we considered this bill today not in the spirit of openness and bipartisanship that should categorize the democratic debate in the house , but with a restrictive rule that did not allow us to have a debate on a key issue : whether one of the highest honors that can be bestowed upon citizens of our country for their extraordinary deeds , a congressional gold medal , can be awarded to one individual or more for their collective honorable or heroic actions . mr. speaker , if this bill passes in its current form , not only would it limit medals to two per year , but it would prevent the house of representatives and the senate from awarding medals in the future to any group of individuals for their collective heroic deeds , such as those of the hundreds of first responders that perished in the 9/11 terrorist attacks . i am puzzled why we would act to impose such limits on our own ability to recognize the accomplishments of the citizens that we are elected to represent . and i am even more puzzled that we would fix a process that is not broken , that is bipartisan in nature , and that works remarkably well for all members . the bipartisan process we have in place has allowed us to honor the reverend martin luther king and coretta scott king ; nancy and ronald reagan ; betty and gerald ford ; pope john paul ii ; the little rock nine ; the leaders of brown v. the board of education ; jackie robinson ; civil rights leader dorothy height ; the navajo code talkers ; general henry shelton ; charles schulz ; john cardinal o'connor , archbishop of new york ; father theodore hesburgh ; rosa parks ; nelson mandela ; mother teresa ; frank sinatra ; ruth and billy graham ; ecumenical patriarch bartholomew ; british prime minister tony blair ; and others . but under this bill , mr. speaker , we may not be able to honor nancy and ronald reagan jointly , nor betty and gerald ford jointly , nor martin luther king and coretta scott king jointly , nor the little rock nine , nor the navajo code talkers . and under this bill my colleague , the gentlewoman from texas ( ms. jackson-lee ) xz4001990 , will be prevented from honoring the fallen astronauts from the space shuttle columbia . in the 108th congress the gentlewoman from texas worked hard to gain the requisite two-thirds cosponsorship of the house for a bill that would honor these fallen american heroes posthumously with the congressional gold medal . it is only right that the rule of the house be honored and that her hard-won efforts be not undone by this bill . since the majority party gained control of this house in 1995 , 20 gold medals have been enacted into law either to an individual or a group of individuals . using the process we currently have in place , 10 gold medal bills out of 20 were sponsored by republican members , and 10 were sponsored by democratic members . how can anyone possibly argue that the existing process does not work ? we are fixing something that simply is not broken . unfortunately , the bipartisan spirit that has characterized the house 's consideration of gold medals in the past has not carried over to the debate on this bill . not only did we do not have an open rule , but today represents the first time this house is debating this issue in any form . the committee responsible for legislation on this bill , the committee on financial services , on which i serve , has not held a single hearing on this bill , let alone a markup . the limited debate over this bill on the house floor may culminate in the passing of a bad bill , unless my colleagues join me in voting in favor of sending this bill back to committee , where we can have a meaningful debate , and where we can determine whether limiting gold medals is truly in the interest of the public and in the interest of the house . mr. speaker , the house has become the 109th congress on a bad note : we are considering a bill with almost no meaningful debate , and it proposes to represent a solution to a problem that simply does not exist , a problem the record shows does not exist . does this action foretell what lies ahead in terms of the existence of bipartisanship throughout this congress ? i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the right thing , to vote in favor of my motion to recommit this bill back to the committee on financial services and to allow this house to take a closer look at this legislation to determine whether it really meets the interests of the american people .

'' ",R
"mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume ; and i thank my friend , the gentleman from texas ( mr. sessions ) xz4003670 , for yielding me the time . it is a new year , mr. speaker , a new congress and new presidential term . we have heard new commitments to work across party lines and calls for civility and camaraderie in the halls of the capitol . we have heard the president speak of a more civilized washington and a bipartisan approach to the legislative process . then and now congress starts its work . the rhetoric starts ; reality sets in . we are not even 2 full weeks into the house legislative calendar , and it is starting to sound like the same old song and dance . any way we look at it , mr. speaker , process or policy , the house is off to a bad start . it is the first day of normal legislative business in the 109th congress , and the house is already considering a restrictive rule for a bill that has not gone through proper house procedures . new congress members just coming from parliamentary procedure training session must be doing a double-take . they just spent a week in a refresher course on how a bill becomes a law . then , all of the sudden , that process has not been followed on one of their first votes . i guess i was confused , too , and what i can say to them is , welcome to washington . the proponents of the underlying legislation will try to argue that it is not a new bill because it was first introduced in the 108th congress . while that might be true , the committee on financial services did not act on the bill in the 108th congress , and it has not acted on it in this year . i ask , why is the full house considering a relatively controversial piece of legislation without any committee action ? why the rush ? why set such a precedent for the 109th congress ' beginning ? the committee on financial services , the committee of jurisdiction for the underlying legislation , will not even organize itself until next week , let alone hold a hearing or markup on my good friend 's , and he is my good friend , the gentleman from delaware 's bill . think about it this way : the first bill that the house is considering in the 109th congress under normal rules actually makes it harder to pass legislation and create laws honoring our country 's greatest heroes . just like social security , some of my republican friends are trying to create a problem where one does not exist . as the gentleman from texas already noted , the rule does make in order two amendments offered by my good friend , the gentleman from new york ( mr. crowley ) xz4000870 . the first crowley amendment increases the total number of medals of honor to be permitted awarded from four to six per congress . the second crowley amendment provides for an equitable distribution of gold medals between the majority and the minority . while i intend to support both of these amendments , and certainly appreciate them being made in order , the committee on rules failed to make in order a third crowley amendment which would have maintained the status quo . that amendment would have ensured that worthy groups or individuals and organizations remain eligible to receive the congressional medal of honor . the committee on rules also rejected along a party-line vote an amendment to the rule which would have made it open to all germane amendments . if the underlying legislation were to become law , president and nancy reagan never would have received the medal because they received it as a couple . neither would dr . martin luther king and coretta scott king , joseph delaine and harry and eliza briggs , billy and ruth graham , president and betty ford , the navajo code talkers or the american red cross , just to name a few . can anyone in this body honestly suggest that the individuals aforementioned and organizations are unworthy of this institution 's top award ? is there an epidemic of distributing too many congressional medals of honor to unworthy recipients that somehow or another has escaped at least me in knowing about them ? mr. speaker , i am not worried about congress going on a spree to award the medal of honor to unworthy recipients . the rules applied by the committee on financial services to even consider a bill awarding the congressional medal of honor are so stringent that the integrity and prestige of the award will always be protected . on the contrary , if today is any indication , perhaps we ought to be just a bit more concerned about the integrity of procedure in the house of representatives than about the integrity of a system that is dependent upon bipartisan cooperation . mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .

"if the gentleman would yield , i appreciate my good friend 's good suggestion , and i am prepared to begin yielding time to colleagues who are present to begin speaking . mr. speaker , with that understanding , i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from texas ( ms. jackson-lee ) xz4001990 . ",D
"mr. speaker , i am privileged to announce that we have no further speakers , and i would say to my good friend , the gentleman from texas , we yield back the balance of our time . ",D
"mr. speaker , i thank the distinguished gentleman from florida and ranking member , and the gentleman representing the committee on rules on the republican side and also the author of this legislation . i rise to oppose the rule and the underlying legislation for some of the very reasons that my good friend and colleague from florida has enunciated . i also raise another question , that this body is the people 's house and the people represent a wide diversity of america , heroes and sheroes , little unknown to many of us until they rise and shine . it is interesting that this legislation would come without going to the full committee in this session to be able to have the oversight of the committee structure , and then to be reminded of the fact that we took great joy and pleasure in honoring both president reagan and mrs. reagan , dr . king and mrs. king , and of course , legislation that i proposed to acknowledge the columbia seven that tragically lost their lives on our behalf as astronauts and heroes in space . all right . i recognize that judgment is necessary , but this legislation does not speak to judgment . it speaks to denial , and it denies the congress its authoritative right to make decisions on who has represented america in the most honorable way to deserve a congressional gold medal . the legislation that i have has over 320-plus sponsors out of 435 and growing . individual members acquiesced and affirmed the fact that these individuals were worthy of a congressional gold medal . i agree , as well , that the committee on financial services has put in place a very effective , very effective oversight of this process . let me thank the gentleman from new york ( mr. crowley ) xz4000870 for his insight in his amendments that would expand the numbers for the congressional session and also bifurcate or equalize the numbers for each party . i , too , believe that there should be restraint in judgment , but i believe as well that america has her heroes and sheroes and who are we in 2005 to predict what might happen in 2010 or 2015 or 2020 where there may be a multitude of heroes who americans believe are deserving of this worthy award . i am disappointed and saddened that this could not be a bipartisan process . i , for one , believe that we should overwhelmingly vote against the rule and overwhelmingly vote against this intrusion into the objective and the precise and the bipartisan decisions that have been made on ronald reagan and mrs. reagan , the president of the united states ; dr . king and mrs. king , very surely representatives of the human and american spirit . i would ask my colleagues to reconsider this legislation and most specifically because it violated , if you will , the precise rules that we adhere to , oversight by committees , the committee on rules ' involvement in an open rule , and the bipartisan spirit in which we honor our heroes and sheroes , whether dead or alive . mr. speaker , i rise to urge my colleagues to defeat the overly restrictive rule that has been reported out of committee relating to h.r. 54 . despite my disappointment and dismay at not only the criteria of this rule but the nature of the underlying legislation , i am pleased that two amendments offered by my colleague from new york , mr. crowley were made in order . the central amendment that would have made this legislation palatable at the very least and not so disrespectful to the heroes that we strive to honor with the congressional gold medal has been effectively blocked by partisan stubbornness . if the import of this legislation is good , why not allow the representatives of this august body to openly debate it before the american people ? are we so ashamed of its true legislative intent that we feel the need to hide behind obstructionist rules ? i say that legislation with bona fide purpose should have nothing to fear -- at the very least should it fear honest and open debate . the underlying legislation that is before this house seeks to `` provide reasonable standards for congressional gold medals '' but will essentially limit the bestowal of honor to american icons . one of the main reasons that the medal is bestowed is to make the highest expression of national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions . h.r. 54 will summarily restrict this goal and prevent many honored heroes from receiving proper recognition . blocking debate on a provision that is utterly unreasonable is disrespectful to the constituents that members seek to honor with the congressional gold medal . mr. speaker , i oppose this rule and i urge my colleagues to defeat it . ",D
"mr. chairman , the angst that i have with h.r. 54 does not speak to the eloquence that we have heard on the floor about our commitment to honoring our heroes and sheroes . let me make it perfectly clear , despite all of the accolades that we have spoken today , if this legislation were in place , president reagan and mrs. reagan would not receive the congressional gold medal ; neither would dr . king and mrs. coretta scott king ; neither would the indian code talkers who helped save thousands of lives in world war ii . i think that is the crux of this debate , not whether or not we have restrictions or nonrestrictions because i believe it is a given that the committee on financial services has done a commendable job in its oversight . as i look back on the numbers in the last four congresses , how interesting it is and the good sense of the crowley amendment because those that have been passed by this body only equal to five or six credible , rational and reasonable reasoning for awarding , for example , those who were intimately involved in brown v. board of education that changed the lives of millions of americans and today even is a standard for equal education in america . mr. chairman , i am confused by the necessity of this legislation and why we would not be able to enthusiastically support the very precise , as i said previously , and thoughtful amendments by the gentleman from new york ( mr. crowley ) xz4000870 , particularly those dealing with the idea of the number of gold medals , increasing them to six per congress . that is 2 years , that means three and three possibly , or however it is broken down , and then the fairness of equal distribution between republicans and democrats , all of us , of course , being americans . what is to argue the case or why would we argue the case that there were those who contributed together who are not worthy . i do not take this as any kind of personal act by my republican friends , but i do think it is a misstep in judgment and that we would have benefited from a more bipartisan overview , review of this legislation . for example , we would not have been able to honor , as some americans perceive as very important , ruth and billy graham . so this narrow or narrowing or this interpretation of one hero when there may be an adequate partnering that may be important that would symbolize the greatness and goodness of america puzzles me and , in fact , disturbs me . frankly , the civil rights movement was a group effort and it might be likely that one would want to honor the group of civil rights activists , the unknown , the unsung heroes that we are able to bring to the attention of the united states congress . how many really knew harry and eliza briggs ? how many knew levi pearson ? but once we debated and found out the facts , we knew that they were in fact heroes and sheroes . i think we do ourselves an enormous disservice by coming down hard-handed on who has given so much for america . and then i would say why start with divisive legislation . yes , there are only a few of us on the floor of the house , but we obviously are not able to speak for all of those unsung heroes yet to be brought to the attention of this house . all of us come in our course of life to meet people in our districts and around the country where we claim that we want to bring them to the attention of the american people not frivolously ; but after we have looked at the history , we know they are truly worthy of a congressional gold medal . so why we need this restrictive law that has not already been satisfied by the oversight of a bipartisan committee on financial services and the requirement , mr. chairman , the requirement of over 290 signatures , and most of these received close to 400 . and that is the test , whether your colleagues will support you . mr. chairman , in support of the gentleman 's two amendments , i am querying as to the amendment offered which would really balance this legislation which would speak to protect president reagan and dr . and mrs. billy graham and others who came together . ",D
i yield to the gentleman from new york . ,D
"mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for his leadership and simply say that is the spirit of bipartisanship . that would have been reflective of members having an opportunity in their wisdom to present their case before the united states congress and the committee on financial services . that would have been fairness to the unsung heroes . that would have been in respect to president and mrs. reagan , dr . king and mrs. king , dr . graham and mrs. graham , as well as many others . i ask my colleagues to vote against this legislation , allow us to work in a bipartisan manner and do not take away from those as yet unrecognized the honor of a congressional gold medal . mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the bill before the committee of the whole because it is unreasonably restrictive . its passage will result in the preclusion of our ability to pay tribute to americans in the most respectful manner . the central amendment that would have made this legislation palatable at the very least and not so disrespectful to the heroes that we strive to honor with the congressional gold medal has been effectively blocked by partisan stubbornness . if the import of this legislation is good , why not allow the representatives of this august body to openly debate it before the american people ? are we so ashamed of its true legislative intent that we feel the need to hide behind obstructionist rules ? i say that legislation with bona fide purpose should have nothing to fear -- at the very least should it fear honest and open debate . the underlying legislation that is before this house seeks to `` provide reasonable standards for congressional gold medals '' but will essentially limit the bestowal of honor to american icons . one of the main reasons that the medal is bestowed is to make the highest expression of national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions . h.r. 54 will summarily restrict this goal and prevent many honored heroes from receiving proper recognition . section 2 , paragraph ( e ) ( 2 ) ( a ) of h.r. 54 would limit the striking of a congressional gold medal to `` only an individual. '' such `` unreasonably '' restrictive legislation would preclude the bestowal of this award collectively to the 9 students who `` voluntarily subjected themselves to racial bigotry during the integration of central high school in little rock , arkansas , otherwise known as the `` little rock nine. '' similarly , under this restrictive provision , the secretary of the treasury can not lawfully strike a congressional gold medal to honor former president ronald reagan and his wife nancy reagan in recognition of their services to america or to honor former president jimmy carter and his wife rosalynn carter . furthermore , h.r. 54 would make it illegal for congress to cause the secretary to strike a congressional gold medal to honor the monumental contributions made to the civil rights movement by dr . martin luther king , jr . and his widow , coretta scott king , or the brave employees and others who responded to the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon and perished and to the people aboard united airlines flight 93 who resisted hijackers and caused the plane to crash . mr. chairman , i oppose this legislation and ask that my colleagues join me to defeat it unless the overly restrictive provisions are fixed or removed .

"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . today , i rise in support of h.r. 54 , the congressional gold medal enhancement act of 2005 , authored by the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 , and urge its immediate passage . the legislation is a commonsense effort to maintain the prestige of this award . as the members know , the gold medal is the highest civilian honor bestowed by congress . it has been awarded to a long and distinguished line of individuals who have made significant contributions to this country , beginning with general george washington even before the declaration of independence . recipients have included civil rights leaders , cultural icons and leaders in science . but a disturbing trend has emerged since the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 sensibly reformed the commemorative coin program a decade ago . until that point , congress approved the awarding of only a few , usually one or two , gold medals each congress , but approved as many as a dozen commemorative coin programs , often at great cost to taxpayers . chairman castle 's reforms eliminated the cost to the taxpayers , restoring the dignity to the commemorative coin program . he also instituted a requirement that two-thirds of the house should sponsor legislation for either commemorative coins or gold medals before consideration could take place so that support would be broad and bipartisan . those reforms have been successful , but denied the opportunity to enact numerous commemorative coin programs , congress increasingly has turned to the gold medal program , and we now find ourselves in a situation of having fewer honorees for commemorative coins than we do from gold medals . during the last congress , only three commemorative coins were struck , and we approved five medal programs honoring seven individuals . by comparison , in the first 123 years of the gold medal , only 45 people were so honored . mr. chairman , all medal honorees to date have been good choices and well deserving of the honor . however , we could be faced with a quandary : either approve a medal for an individual who has had some accomplishment , but probably is not at the same level as a general washington or a jonas salk , or else decline to approve the legislation . we should not let ourselves get into that situation , mr. chairman . chairman castle 's common-sense limit of two gold medals a year , and limiting the recipients to individuals rather than groups , maintains the prestige and honor of receiving a congressional gold medal . combined with the requirement of a minimum cosponsorship level of two-thirds of the house is the best way to preserve the integrity of the gold medal . at the appropriate time , i will offer a manager 's amendment that seeks to change the effective date of this legislation from december 31 of this year to immediately upon enactment so that the rules for awarding medals would remain the same throughout this congress and not change midsession . mr. chairman , i urge immediate passage of this legislation . mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .

"mr. chairman , i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 , the sponsor of the legislation . ",R
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . mr. chairman , let me close by first indicating to the gentleman from new york ( mr. crowley ) xz4000870 that the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 as well as myself acknowledge that the folks who received the medal in the past were most deserving . i would point out , in fact , that the medal that was awarded , for example , to ronald and nancy reagan , was one medal , and the same thing with dr . king and coretta scott king , and betty and gerald ford . couples are treated much differently from a group . i guess perhaps what i found in studying this , perhaps the most egregious example of going beyond what the initial scope of the medal was was in the 106th congress where we awarded five medal bills , one of them was for the navajo code talkers which did not go in regular order . it was attached at the last minute to an appropriations bill . it not only covered the 29 original code talkers but also an additional 275 of those who qualified as code talkers . i guess , and i do not want to speak for the sponsor of the legislation , but i think it points out the need to tighten these requirements . that is what the purpose of this legislation is all about . ",R
"if the bill were passed , the answer is no , they would not . ",R
"mr. chairman , let me point out in the case of the navajo code talkers , there were other tribes also that had code talkers , not just the navajo . again , the issue is where do we start and where do we finish in this area . again , going back to the history of the medal , and the first recipient was george washington , it was to an individual and was to an individual for a very , very long period of time . the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 pointed out correctly , historically the gold medal was given out quite rarely , 45 in 123 years , to individuals . the change ironically was brought about with the change in the commemorative coin program that did in fact move the congress to adopting more gold medals . this is an effort to try to get back to where history started us , awarding that medal to an individual and awarding it not to a group , no matter how small or how large , and that really was the intent of the legislation . ",R
"i yield to my friend from delaware , the sponsor of the legislation . ",R
"reclaiming my time , and the gentleman may want to respond . let me just comment . there is an avenue , i would suggest to my friend from new york , to honor large groups . that would be the commemorative coin . it is somewhat ironic that after the reforms that were made by the gentleman from delaware where we tightened the restrictions on commemorative coins , and for good reason , that we then had this increase in the gold medal . i think we can safely say that the gold medal traditionally supports the concept of honoring an individual for service to the country , and that the commemorative coin , which has been essentially put on the back burner , presents a very appropriate avenue for recognizing groups that heretofore have not been honored . i think that the reforms in the past and the ones that the gentleman from delaware is now propounding in this bill makes excellent sense . i think once the members understand the changes , that they are going to gravitate toward the concept of a commemorative coin as opposed to the gold medal . that is precisely what the gentleman from delaware proposes in this legislation . ",R
"let me , in closing , mr. chairman , indicate , first of all , my respect for the members who have undertaken the responsibility of going out and getting 290 signatures . virtually everyone i have talked to said , never again , because of the difficulty . i said , well , think of it this way . you get a chance to meet a lot of new friends . every time you walk over or ride over for a vote , every time you see a member in the dining room , wherever it may be , you are getting their support . but it is a difficult process . i think the gentleman from delaware was right in raising that bar to where it is now , because it really does focus one 's attention on how difficult that process is . it does make it , by definition , a bipartisan process . that is a fact of life that we deal with time and time again . the legislation before us , i think , does restore the medal to what it was envisioned to be way back in 1776 . mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . ",R
"mr. chairman , i yield myself as much time as i may consume . mr. chairman , the amendment changes the effective date of the introduced version of the bill from after december 31 , 2005 to instead make the new limitation on the number of congressional gold medals effective on enactment of the bill . the change will be made so that uniform guidelines governing the medal program will be in effect for the whole 109th congress and beyond and not change in the middle of the congress . if we were to pass the bill but leave the effective date until the end of the session there would be a land rush to enact bills on gold medals that would place members in an awkward position . mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . ",R
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . the amendment offered by the gentleman from new york is really in many ways contrary to the reforms that are already enacted , led by the gentleman from delaware and the one that is now before us . the institution of two-thirds of the members was very important , and the reforms in the commemorative coin reform act , which was adopted almost 10 years ago , instituted a two-coin-per-year maximum . the reforms in that program have worked perfectly . congress has not passed more than two programs for issue in any year since the law passed in 1996 . one year , in 2003 , only one coin was issued . the reforms have restored the dignity of the commemorative coin program , which had spun out of control ; and similar reforms will do the same for a congressional gold medal . so it seems to me a natural progression in the reform process . and , indeed , mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .

"mr. chairman , i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 . ",R
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . i do oppose the amendment . i have some empathy for the first amendment offered by the gentleman from new york , but certainly not this one . clearly , if there is a bipartisan element to this whole idea of getting two-thirds of the people supporting it , it is the congressional gold medal , and i think the gentleman somewhat undercuts his own argument by giving us the figures that he did because , in fact , i do not think most members , when they are approached by a member carrying that bill , really are concerned about whether it is a republican sponsor or a democrat sponsor . they are concerned about who that individual being honored is . and just by the definition of having two-thirds sponsor would indicate a strong bipartisan support and historically that has always been the case . and i think that the amendment would tend to compartmentalize the authors of these gold medal resolutions that would be difficult to enforce and perhaps would cause some kind of a rush to try to get the necessary signatures prematurely . so i think it is really difficult for the committee , for example . as the gentleman knows , who has served on my committee with great distinction , we pride ourselves on the bipartisanship of the committee and the leadership of the committee , and we have continued to do so . so i think this is superfluous at best and , as a result , would oppose the amendment . mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .

"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . mr. chairman , to close , and again in opposition , i think it is unfortunate and really not necessary to put republican-democrat in the statute . that is really what we are trying to do ; that is what the gentleman from new york is trying to do . this is an issue that needs to be worked out at the leadership level , which traditionally has been the case . the last example that the gentleman mentioned , i do not know what all that had to do with , but i think it was above our pay grade . but at the same time , that is how it works , and to encase republican and democrat in the statute i think at this time would certainly not be in the best interests of the process , and that is why i continue to oppose my friend 's amendment . mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .

"mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit . ",R
"first of all , mr. speaker , let me point out that this is a motion with instructions , so it does not go back to the committee on financial services , it would automatically come back to the floor . secondly , i want to applaud the gentleman from delaware , who sponsored this legislation . the concept behind the gold medal , the highest award that the congress can provide , has historically been given , historically , to an individual . the first individual was george washington , even before the declaration of independence . historically that was the case . in the first 123 years of the existence of our country , only 45 medals were given out , all of them to individuals . since that time , we have had a tenfold increase in the next subsequent 100 years . and the gentleman from delaware is right , we need to reform the system . there is bipartisanship in the existing system because it involves 290 cosponsors , so everybody gets an opportunity to weigh in on the importance of the medal . there is an opportunity now with commemorative coins to honor groups as opposed to the individual medal . so the gentleman from delaware needs to be congratulated on forward-looking reforms , just as he did in the commemorative coin program . this is an effort , really , to gut these reforms , this so-called motion to recommit , and that is why i oppose it . we had extensive debate during general debate , as well as the two amendments offered by my friend from new york , and so i would ask that the motion to recommit be defeated ; that we pass this legislation ; and then get on to the work of defining two medals each year , a maximum of two medals each year , four for the congress , to honor individuals who have had extraordinary contributions to our country . let us go back to what the original intent of the founding fathers was in this gold medal . i think it is important to do so .

"mr. speaker , i rise in support of h. con . res. 36 . once again , activist judges threaten our authority , first of all , to direct federal fund spending ; and , second of all , they attempt to create law . we have required here in congress at universities that receive federal dollars to extend access to military recruiters equal to other outside groups . but in the name of free speech and association , some schools seek to deny their students access to recruiters and rotc , obviously afraid that their students would maybe even make a wrong choice . it is ironic that an institution whose sole function , whole reason for being , is based on the free exchange of ideas , would then boycott the armed forces , the very people who actively protect their academic freedom . it is further ironic that those who are often noted for concern that low-income americans are serving in disproportionate numbers in the armed forces would block many of their students born with a silver spoon access to rotc . my own son currently serves in iraq . he graduated near the top of his class from the u.s. naval academy ; and , last sunday , he had the satisfaction of witnessing the birth of freedom in a land where for 50 years freedom has been an exotic concept . by passing h. con . res. 36 , we reassert our support for freedom and our disdain for those liberal , elite institutions that seek to sensor choices for their wealthy clientele . ",R
"mr. speaker , i rise today in opposition to this resolution . in wisconsin , our state laws provide protections from discrimination to people that go beyond what many other states and what the federal government have put into law . such protections as nondiscrimination based on age , gender , marital status , membership in the national guard and sexual orientation are a part of wisconsin 's nondiscrimination laws . wisconsin has chosen to provide its citizens with these greater protections because we have decided that these are in the best interests of our citizens and are good public policy . the university of wisconsin in madison has a history as a leader in social justice . it adheres to state laws and has tried to apply those laws appropriately across its campus . that has included the requirement that campus organizations , departments and campus recruiters adhere to state law . yet federal law has intervened to block enforcement of campus policy and state law in regard to military recruiters . the solomon amendment was passed by a previous congress because students , like those at the university of wisconsin , were having success in blocking recruiters from campus if they discriminate against lesbians or gays or bisexuals in violation of state law and campus policy . access to and use of campus facilities to recruit students for higher educational opportunities , employment or military service should be at the discretion of the institution . of course , public institutions should not arbitrarily discriminate against any particular recruiter . reasonable and legitimate criteria should be evenly applied to every recruiter . the federal government should not use federal funding as a weapon to force noncompliance with state law or to create special rights for military recruiters . i believe that the court made the correct decision in invalidating the solomon amendment . i also believe that today 's resolution is unnecessary . in fact , i believe that today 's debate is the wrong debate . we should be looking at ways to strengthen our military and expand our resources for winning the fight against al qaeda and other terrorist organizations . mr. speaker , when will we have the debate about the harm caused by excluding so many qualified , skilled americans from serving in our military simply because they are gay or lesbian ? when will we have a debate about the waste of resources used to discharge fully trained personnel who are serving our country honorably ? when will we have the debate about how much our fight against terrorism is hurt by the discharges of arab linguists ? the resolution before us today makes vague reference to the costs to the military in having to arrange alternative recruitment strategies to meet its goals , but it does not mention the significant cost of do n't ask , do n't tell to our defense budget and to our national security . since do n't ask , do n't tell took effect in 1993 , approximately 10 , 000 military personnel have been discharged . that is a huge amount of training and experience that we have lost . in a study of discharges between 1998 and 2003 , university of santa barbara researchers found that , of 6 , 273 discharges , many were in critical specialties such as 88 linguists , including many arabic speakers , 49 wmd experts , 90 nuclear power engineers , and 150 rocket and missile specialists . to compensate for some of these discharges , the pentagon has been calling up members of the individual ready reserve . the harm to our military readiness and the cost to our security caused by do n't ask , do n't tell is clear . urging the administration to try to reinstate the solomon amendment will in no way make our country safer . let there be no mistake . i strongly support our men and women in uniform . i want to take this opportunity to honor the men and women in our armed forces who have served and continue to serve in iraq and to the many serving our country here and around the world . their efforts allowed the iraqi people to vote in a free election this week . their bravery and dedication is something all americans should admire and honor . mr. speaker , there would be no clamor for a solomon amendment if we simply allowed all qualified americans to serve their country in uniform . our country would be safer , our human resources would be greater , our country would be stronger if we treated all americans equally , regardless of their sexual orientation . it is time to repeal do n't ask , do n't tell . it will make our military stronger and our country stronger . ",D
"mr. speaker , let me thank my colleague for yielding me this time . mr. speaker , today i rise in strong support of this resolution , which shows our nation 's unwavering commitment to both higher education and providing a strong national defense . at no time in recent memory has our country placed more responsibility on the shoulders of our men and women in uniform . we are fighting a war on terrorism on multiple fronts , in afghanistan and iraq . and it is essential that if we are to be victorious in defending our freedom and protecting our homeland that we promote military service as an option to college students across the united states . when this congress passed and president bush signed into law the no child left behind act , the bill made it easier for military recruiters to inform america 's high school students about their options to serve their country , while also giving parents a choice about whether or not they want their sons and daughters to be contacted individually by military recruiters . now in this resolution we are reiterating the choices given to institutions of higher education . the solomon act , originally passed in 1995 , grants the secretary of defense power to deny federal funding to institutions of higher learning if they prohibit military recruitment on campus . this law recognizes the importance of having a capable , educated and well-prepared military , one that is ready to defend american liberties such as freedom of speech and higher education . if we deny armed forces recruiters the opportunity to actively recruit in schools , we not only disrespect the sacrifices of military men and women who have made our freedom possible ; we also rob our students of the valuable opportunities that military service can be to our nation and what they can help provide . there is no reason not to allow the nation 's armed services to make their best case to college students and to do so in the same manner as private sector employers that colleges and universities seem to relish having on campus . denial of access and equality to military recruiters by colleges that receive federal funds is an insult to the taxpayers who help subsidize higher education in this country . many nations have mandatory military service for their citizens . we do not . the very core of our system of homeland security and national defense depends on young men and women deciding that they wish to serve our country . successful recruitment of the best officers in our military relies heavily on our military recruiters ' access to the best and the brightest . and it seems a bit disingenuous for the elite institutions of higher education , such as harvard , yale , stanford , georgetown , and new york university , to condemn the lack of the wealthy and privileged in the ranks of our military while these schools deny their students the option of even hearing about a career in our united states military . this resolution should not be politicized . it is a straightforward reaffirmation of our armed forces and our students . congress does not force colleges and universities to accept federal funding . if an institution of higher learning wishes to bar military recruiters from recruiting , it is free to do so . but federal funding is not an entitlement and such institutions should not expect that decision to be endorsed and subsidized by the taxpayers of the united states . the resolution reaffirms our commitment to that principle . and i want to commend the gentleman from california ( mr. hunter ) xz4001910 and i also want to thank the gentleman from minnesota ( mr. kline ) xz4002240 for bringing this resolution to the floor and urge my colleagues to support it . ",R
"mr. speaker , i rise in full support of this resolution and urge my colleagues to support its passage . asking the administration to appeal the third circuit is the right thing to do . what is happening on some college campuses is deja vu for those of us who attended colleges in the 1960s and the 1970s . back then too many college administrators lacked the courage to resist pressure from then what were called left-wing student groups and other professors to ban military recruiters from their campuses . as a result , students who sought military careers were denied equal access to careers of their choice and our schools became the centers for a wide range of nonsense courses . the student protestors of the 1960s and 1970s and those of like mind are now the administrators and professors of colleges and universities all over the country . clearly , they have neither changed their politics nor loathing for the american military . even at a time when our servicemen and -women are encouraged to defeat the forces of tyranny and terror , they remain the same . in denying military recruiters equal access to campuses such as harvard law school , college administrators violate the most basic principles of the right to associate and free speech they so profess is precious . despite large numbers of conservative students attending their institutions , these liberals preach tolerance ; however , these liberal administrators and professors have now become the most intolerant people i know . the following quote is from a student typical of the attitude of many of these ivory bastions : `` the day my political science department hires a republican and i am allowed to sit in a class without a number of snickers , jeers , and/or dirty looks when president bush 's name is even mentioned is the day i will admit there is progress on today 's campus. '' mr. speaker , congress did not ask for special access for military recruiters . we are asking for just equal access to groups such as those seeking support for such liberal causes as abortion rights , frivolous lawsuits , same-sex marriage , elimination of the right to private property , gun control , orwellian big government . mr. speaker , once again activist judges have clearly overstepped their authority , and it is time for the administration to stand and say that the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit was wrong in their ruling and please seek an appeal .

"mr. speaker , by direction of the committee on rules , i call up house resolution 59 and ask for its immediate consideration . ",R
"mr. speaker , for the purpose of debate only , i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. mcgovern ) xz4002630 , pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume . during consideration of this resolution , all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only . mr. speaker , on tuesday the committee on rules met and granted a rule for house concurrent resolution 36 , expressing congressional support for equal access of military recruiters to institutions of higher education . the rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on armed services . the rule also provides for one motion to recommit . mr. speaker , this concurrent resolution is an important first step in addressing a misguided ruling by the third circuit court of appeals regarding access of military recruiters to institutions of higher education . during this time of conflict and the global war on terror , it is more important than ever to maintain the ability to recruit quality men and women for service in our military . the primary way that recruiters are able to do this is to work through those institutions which work closely with our young men and women , schools and universities . military recruiters need the same access to college campuses provided to other potential employers , and students deserve the right to discuss the option of a career in the united states military with the representatives of the armed forces . mr. speaker , some ask , why the need for this concurrent resolution ? well , the answer is succinct . this concurrent resolution grows out of an egregious decision by the third circuit court of appeals overturning the power of congress to control the purse . this decision simply states that congress and the government may not as a matter of law deny funds to universities on the basis of their denial of access to recruiters and rotc units . this decision , couched in the language of civil rights , fails to recognize the underlying inequity behind these university policies . this decision asserts the congress has compelled speech by these universities to the effect that they `` agree '' with the military 's `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy with respect to homosexuals in the service . mr. speaker , nothing could be further than the truth . the solomon amendment compelled no such thing . it simply proposed standards for the receipt of federal funds . setting such standards is a normal and legitimate function of the legislative branch . it is what defines the power of the purse . this is an issue that the house and senate have revisited and affirmed in bipartisan votes in 1995 , 1996 , 1999 , and 2002 after the enactment of the original solomon amendment . mr. speaker , it is disappointing to note that the reserve officers training corps , or popularly known as the rotc , has been embattled on some university and college campuses since the 1960s . this stems from what only can be described as a consistently anti-military philosophy advocated by some , and i want to say only some , college and university professors and administrators . the new purported reasons for not allowing rotc on campus often serves the convenient cover for these anti-military sentiments . some educators now believe that they should be allowed to discriminate against students who wish to enter the military in order to please another group of students who object to the policies and procedures of the armed services , all the while soliciting and accepting federal funds for their institutions . this is rank hypocrisy . why would an institution seek and use federal funds , often from the department of defense , while denying representatives of the u.s. armed forces access to their campuses ? mr. speaker , the decision by the third circuit court of appeals is a classic case of judicial overreach and one that must be addressed . as a former university educator and the son of a career air force noncommissioned officer , i find this decision disturbing and insulting to those men and women who defend our freedom and to those who wish to join their ranks . the very least we can do is put the courts on notice as to exactly where the congress stands on this issue . for that reason , this concurrent resolution is necessary and timely . hopefully , it will underscore the importance that the congress places on military recruiters having access to the educational institutions that receive federal funds . during this time of war , we should insist that institutions who pride themselves on freedom of expression allow the defenders of that freedom , the united states military , to freely recruit the soldiers who protect our democracy . to that end , i urge support for the rule and the underlying bill . mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . ",R
"mr. speaker , i yield to myself such time as i may consume . i would like to quickly address a couple of the concerns that my colleague raised . while i certainly respect his concerns , i would like to point out that the measure in question had been on our web site for 4 days and was not suddenly introduced yesterday . it had easy access . frankly , on the nature of the rule itself , it is the opinion of the majority of the committee this is simply an up or down matter . it is not something we need to amend or deal with . let me make one other point , if i may , mr. speaker , in reference to the access of the military to college campuses . the military is a rather unique institution , but nothing prohibits college campuses from denying them access . all the solomon amendment does is says , if they do , they lose some federal funds as a consequence . i would think that if they felt strongly , that this was a position of conviction , they would not want funds from the department of defense and other institutions . they would simply have nothing to do with them . further , i would simply like to make one additional point . the appropriate place to protest the policy , frankly , is in the political arena . this is not a policy in the department of defense per se . this is a policy devised by president clinton , has been ratified repeatedly by congress as a political avenue to address it . we should not put that burden on recruiters in the military and subject them to difficult circumstances when they are carrying out important work for our country . mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from missouri ( mr. akin ) xz4000050 .

"mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume ; and in closing , i would like to say i think we have had a good and substantive debate today , but let us be clear : the concurrent resolution is really about ensuring those who defend our freedom and liberty the ability to have the same access to colleges and universities that is available for everyone else . mr. speaker , often today others have placed this debate in the context of the `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy . i suggest that those who would like to change that policy , that they look inward , at the political process itself . this was president clinton 's policy , and one enshrined in law that can only be changed by congress . if the other side of the aisle would like to make this change , they should propose it and debate it at this level . to put it in the context of the solomon amendment , i believe , is disingenuous and dangerous to our recruiting efforts . i urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying concurrent resolution . mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . the previous question was ordered . the resolution was agreed to . a motion to reconsider was laid on the table . ",R
"mr. speaker , issues like this one -- first brought to our attention with a passion and eloquence only possible in a man like jerry solomon -- provide our democracy a valuable service : they cut through the fog of spin and force us to tell the american people exactly where we stand . pure and simple , this bills says our armed services -- the army , navy , air force , marines , coast guard , and national guard -- should have the same right to recruit at colleges and universities who receive federal funding as any other group . every year , thousands upon thousands of businesses , industries , non-profit groups , and even other colleges recruit underclassmen to sign up to become investment bankers and computer engineers or environmental lawyers or medical students . and yet , some colleges -- principally the elitist and elite colleges -- refuse to even allow military recruiters on their campuses . such policies are obnoxious in times of peace , but they are simply intolerable in times of war , and the equal access of our military recruiters to federally funded colleges and universities must be protected . but that , mr. speaker , is the easy part . the hard part is understanding why facilities and administrations of these colleges do n't want military recruiters on their campuses . because , at bottom , their opposition to the presence of veterans at their schools is not about academic freedom , or civil liberties . it 's about them not liking the military , or the values our men and women in uniform represent . it 's about many of them preferring the company of people who blame the united states for 9/11 -- who compare the world trade center victims to nazis -- to the company of a soldier or a sailor or an airman or a marine . it 's about academia feeling more sympathy for terrorists than for the women and children they murder . it 's about a fundamental misconception about the purpose of a university -- the professors are there for the students , mr. speaker , and not the other way around . that our military makes our academia possible , and not the other way around . indeed , the right of tenured academics to be publicly insufferable exists only because of the sacrifices of our servicemen and women . the least they could offer in return is a booth in the field house on career day . of course , men and women who have dodged bullets and held dying comrades in their arms do n't take seriously people who live by the glib professional code `` publish or perish. '' but those elite campuses , who claim to educate our nation 's best and brightest , who claim to train our leaders of the future : how can we possibly not allow military recruiters to have the right to talk to such students ? what profession , if any in our entire society , needs the opportunity to recruit the sharpest and broadest minds of every generation more than our armed forces ? america 's armed services have molded great men from all walks of life , and when given brilliant men and women , they have produced legends . how can we let such minds pass through our top colleges without even the chance that they might bump into a veteran recruiter who could change their life ? america in the future no doubt will need its brilliant businessmen and lawyers and poets , but what good can such genius do without brilliant admirals and generals to protect them ? mr. speaker , it 's a shame this issue was ever forced on us at all , but the vote on this bill will help to clarify exactly what we each mean when we say we support the troops . we 'll finally see who among us really believes the military deserves more than just lip service from those of us they protect . votes like this , after all , remind us of one of the great blessings of american democracy : that unlike college professors , congressmen do n't have tenure . ",R
"mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this resolution . it may seem peculiar , but , frankly , i think that the military does not need this resolution . it is not broken out there . they are having the ability to recruit . even despite the negative news from iraq , the recruitment numbers are up for all the services . what this resolution does is sort of breaks this feeling in america that democracy allows divergence of opinion and that the people that own the real estate should have a voice in who can visit that real estate . we do not have any nationally owned universities , yet this resolution requires equal access for all military recruiters at institutions of higher education . i think we are getting into a really slippery area here because you are going to create within those campuses huge debates that students are going to say , we do n't like this stuff being jammed down our throats . we and the faculty and the trustees of a university ought to be able to decide who can visit our campus , as they do in all other things . for example , here in washington , d.c. , catholic university does not allow pro-abortionist recruiters to come and talk on the campus , and here you are going to require , regardless of what the issue should be , that military recruiters have to be allowed on campus . i think it is a very slippery slope . i do not think we need to go there , because the recruitment numbers are not down . i think the military has historically stood on its own feet to do very well in recruiting without getting congress involved mandating that they have to be on campuses . i think you are going to have a negative reaction . i would urge congress very carefully to think about this and to vote `` no '' until we get a better thought on how we want to mandate democracy in this country . ",D
"mr. speaker , i come to the floor today in strong opposition to h. con . res. 36 . it is a standard practice for institutions of higher learning to include a non-discrimination policy as part of their mission . these policies affirm that they do not tolerate discrimination on any number of issues : race , sex , religion , age , disability , social class , and sexual orientation . these non-discrimination policies were created so that all people in our country have the opportunity to be an equal and respected member of higher education communities . unfortunately the military has established a discriminatory policy , do n't ask do n't tell . this policy unfairly excludes homosexuals from military service on the basis of their sexual orientation alone . for example , numerous military linguists who are critically needed in the global war on terrorism have been discharged under do n't ask do n't tell . supporters of h. con . res. 36 say that denying military recruiters access to college campuses is a national security threat , but they are completely missing the big picture . the real national security threat is the do n't ask do n't tell policy that forces our military to discharge gay servicemen and servicewomen regardless of their job performance . i strongly believe that the non-discrimination policies of colleges and universities should be respected and i urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution . ",D
"mr. speaker , will the gentleman yield ? ",D
"mr. speaker , i am wondering , based on that argument , in the interest of efficiency , whether we might not substitute chat rooms for the floor of the house , and if being on the web site is a satisfactory way to bring a bill out . maybe if we had chat rooms or instant messaging , we could probably save a lot more . i would urge the majority , since this traditional kind of old-fashioned type of democracy does not seem to have much appeal , to go right ahead , might even save a little more money , by cutting back on what thomas jefferson or abe lincoln or one of those people might have thought was an appropriate way to conduct the business of democracy . ",D
"to begin , mr. speaker , it is absolutely backwards to decry this policy of excluding recruiters from using the facilities of a university . let us be clear : no university can ban a recruiter from coming to that city or that town . no university can say that students will not talk to the recruiter . the question is not whether the recruiters can come and advertise ; it is whether they can compel the university to offer its facilities involving a policy with which they disagree . but to say that that causes a problem in getting people in the military , it is the supporters of a policy that say to able-bodied men and women , we disapprove of your sexuality , and , therefore , no matter how talented you are , no matter how patriotic you are , no matter what skills you bring , you are not allowed here . colin powell , when he was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , testified before this congress that there was no argument that gay and lesbian men and women in the military were in any way deficient as members of the military . he made it clear . the only reason for excluding them was the prejudice of others . that was the only reason . the argument was : if you let these people in , and he said they had been good soldiers and good airmen and good sailors , it would be disruptive . well , one , that was 15 years ago when he said that . i think society has moved some . but , second , we have experience to the contrary . i know there have been people critical of the israeli defense forces in some respects . i think they deserve , on the whole , a lot of credit for a difficult job . in the israeli defense forces , people serve who are openly gay and lesbian . so the argument that somehow allowing people who are honest about their sexuality , if they are gay or lesbian , to serve in the military makes you an ineffectual military , how do they explain the israeli defense forces ? in fact , what we are again being told is that good people , able people , and we heard reference to the linguists . this has become the policy of `` do n't ask , do n't tell , and by no means translate. '' you who support this policy are the ones , mr. speaker , who are depriving the armed services of able-bodied people . you are the ones who have driven thousands , literally thousands of perfectly capable men and women out of the military because you disapprove of what they do in their spare time . so then to claim that it is the universities trying to stand up for a principle that are weakening the military gets it absolutely backwards . i was also saddened , i must say , by one of the previous speakers who said he wanted to express his disdain for the universities involved . we have universities here which are trying to express their disagreement with what they believe , and i agree , but what they believe to be an unfair prejudice that singles out some of their students . i understand disagreement with that , but disdain ? disdain because people in these positions feel that their students should not be unduly stigmatized and denied this opportunity ? if it is so important to have the opportunity , mr. speaker , should not people on the other side say , you can not deny these young people the opportunity to serve in the military . should you not say , you should not deny these young people the opportunity to serve in the military unless they are gay or lesbian . because if they are gay or lesbian , you want to deny them the opportunity to serve in the military regardless of any fault . remember , this is one that says we just stigmatize you from the outset . there is nothing you can do , there is no degree of service you can perform , there is no sacrifice you can offer to make that will allow you to serve your country . and then we will complain because we do not have enough people to serve in the military . and , again , literally thousands have been turned away . the universities are not blocking recruitment . they can not . they are asking for the right to stand up for principle . and now we are told by one other speaker , well , if they do not agree with the policy , you would think they would not accept the money . please . i would say to members , one rule in parliamentary debate : try to avoid saying something that no one will believe . i mean , this notion that if you do not agree with a policy you should boycott the government , which is using your tax money , nobody believes that . people get taxed , and sometimes they agree and sometimes they disagree . we say to people , look , you can voice your opinion , but you can not avoid paying the taxes . and , by the way , it is not money from the military they are seeking . typically , what we have here are law schools . it is law schools , as people have noted , who are doing this . so people have said , well , what about the poor people ? we are not getting enough wealthy people to offset the number of poor people . well , we are talking about lawyers who are being recruited . frankly , the poor people are not being recruited for the judge advocate general 's office . it just does not compute . but what they are saying is , we are not going to allow our facilities to be used in this discriminatory way . and the law schools , by the way , are not themselves , and this is an important point , under the clinton administration the ruling was that we would look at each element of a university separately . and if the law school said no military recruiting , that did not stop the medical school or the school of engineering from applying for federal funds . what you now have is a policy that says if the law school says no , no other entity can get the money . so there is no connection there . the key issue here is this : have we not in this country come to the point where patriotic young gay men and lesbians who are prepared to serve their country will at least be given a chance ? can you not judge them on their merits ? can you not say , okay , we admire your willingness to do this . we will judge you . if it turns out you become disruptive , we will act . but this blanket denial of even the opportunity no matter how talented , no matter how diligent ? you enforce that as a policy , and then you complain that we have people being turned away ? mr. speaker , i hope this resolution is not adopted , and i hope we will begin to reverse this blanket prejudicial policy that says to millions , millions of young american men and women , you need not apply to defend your country because we do not like some aspect about you , even if it is going to be entirely irrelevant to your service . ",D
"mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and today i rise in strong support of the solomon amendment and as a proud cosponsor of the resolution that is before us . for the last several years , a growing number of law schools have subjected military recruiters to various degrees of harassment designed to make military recruiting difficult and to frustrate their objectives . military recruiting on university campuses is one of the primary means by which the armed forces retains highly qualified new military personnel ; and it is an integral , effective , and necessary part of overall military recruiting . the constitution gives congress the power to attach reasonable stipulations to those who accept federal dollars . the solomon law simply ensures that the military has fair access to recruited institutions of higher learning that willingly accept this federal funding . mr. speaker , every year , without fail , the military comes under a great deal of criticism for hiring too many low-income , disadvantaged young adults . however , i find it remarkably ironic that these institutions are obstructing a more balanced recruiting effort that includes a patriotic commitment from all sectors of society . furthermore , the point has to be made that the soldiers , sailors , airmen , and marines that are being treated like second-class citizens at these universities are also the same brave men and women that are providing the freedom these schools enjoy . mr. speaker , efforts by these universities to restrict military recruiter access can only have the harmful effect of increasing federal spending to achieve mandated end-strength goals and ultimately compromising the readiness and performance of our military . in conclusion , mr. speaker , i strongly support this resolution . i sincerely hope there will be a strong bipartisan effort of support , and i commend my good friends from minnesota and alabama for their leadership on this issue . ",R
"mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for the distinguished way in which he has conducted the debate and also the gentleman from alabama ( mr. rogers ) xz4003411 for sponsoring this resolution . mr. speaker , let us make this clear . this is not about some social issue . the real impetus for this barring of the american military from our college campuses is because of the left-wing core of administrators and professors who do not like this country . and we could substitute another protest issue for them in this thing and it would not make a bit of difference . these are the same people who in many cases had protests in favor of the viet cong during the vietnam war . many of them protested our involvement in el salvador , protested our bringing democracy to nicaragua , protested our participation in the first desert storm in the early 1990s , and in this recent bringing of freedom to iraq . they protested all those things . they hate all things military . and the interesting aspect of this debate is that these same left-wing professors and administrators profess to let young people make up their own minds . free thinking is theoretically their trademark . let us have some free thinking . let us allow the military to be on the campuses . let us allow the students to have access to their information , and let us let them make up their own minds . there is no draft here . this is a volunteer military . they do not have to join the military . but the idea that the left-wing professors and administrators have to protect the students from that very military that the gentleman from florida ( mr. miller ) xz4002791 so eloquently described as the protectors of all of our freedoms including their freedoms to have academic freedoms , to protest and to speak freely , the idea that these students have to be shielded from the guarantors of our freedoms is nonsense . ",R
"mr. speaker , i thank my colleague very much for the time . there certainly is no lack of understanding and appreciation for the united states military , particularly in the backdrop of free elections in iraq this past sunday . so , mr. speaker , this is not a debate , if you will , about the value of the military or , in fact , the necessity of giving them a far reach in their recruitment efforts in america . far be it from me , coming from the state of texas , that might be one of the states that has sent the largest numbers of its sons and daughters to the iraq war and afghanistan . having just sent 3 , 000 national guard and reservists troops about a month ago from their families over to iraq and afghanistan , we know full well the importance of the military but , more importantly , the sacrifice that our men and women make in the united states in serving in the military . i also am reminded that , until president truman integrated the armed forces , african americans were told , do not ask and do not apply . so this is not a question of whether or not we allow these individuals to accept federal funds . i would take issue with my colleague to suggest just do not take federal funds if they are not interested . i am disappointed that this is a closed rule , because there are important issues here , and the issues are that universities should not be forced to compromise their nondiscrimination policies . the military has been set aside as one of the most uniquely integrated and nondiscriminatory sections of our government . just because we have do not ask and do not tell does not mean that it is right , and if congress is really concerned about losing the best and the brightest , it should stop , if you will , discriminating against those because of their sexual orientation for any other reason . i am disappointed that in 2005 it was reported that between 1998 and 2004 the military discharged 20 arabic and six farsi language speakers under the do-not-ask-and-do-not-tell policy . it is not without great admiration for our late colleague , congressman solomon , that i rise to just ask my colleagues , why do we close a rule when we can make this a better legislative initiative ? we needed to give the opportunity for the full discussion on discrimination . do my colleagues believe that americans would rise in support of discrimination ? do my colleagues realize that when we debated the 9/11 tragedy it was a gay american on one of our airplanes that engaged with others to be able to detour that airplane from the very site that i stand , to be able to save lives and to save the capitol of the united states of america ? it seems in 2005 , in the shadow of reauthorization of the voters rights act of 1965 , that we might not now recognize that we can do better . i am glad that rotc programs are still on our campuses . in fact , we know that there are more than 52 , 000 now enrolled in rotc programs , up from 48 , 000 in 2000 . that means 52 , 000 of our students . this past year 70 percent of the army 's newly commissioned armies came from rotc . in fact , the defense department has reported meeting all of its recruitment and retention goals in the past several years and is , in fact , actively downsizing certain specialties . but , in the backdrop of that , we also know that we need more troops , particularly if we are going to be part of a peacekeeping effort , not a running-the-government effort in iraq . so i would say , mr. speaker , the reason why i rise with great concerns about a closed rule and ask my colleagues to consider where we are going with this solomon amendment is that we can do better and that there is some merit , great merit , to asking the military to recruit everywhere and to allow universities of free thought to be able to maintain their nondiscriminatory rules and regulations . we can do better together , and i do not know why we discriminate against any american who wants to serve their country . ",D
"mr. speaker , i rise in support of our armed forces and in support of this nation 's continued efforts to give it the additional strength and stability it needs to keep our men and women safe . the members of this house have joined their constituents in mourning the loss of life and injuries sustained in the course of america 's war and subsequent occupation of iraq for two years . since the beginning of the iraq war in march 2003 , 1 , 423 members of the u.s. military have died , which includes 1 , 084 as a result of hostile action and 333 of non-hostile causes . furthermore , my district of houston has experienced two deaths already since january ; six deaths in 2004 ; five in 2003 ; and numerous injuries over the course of the nation 's engagement . no doubt , mr. speaker , i fully support the armed services . in the spirit of achieving the goal of attracting the best and brightest candidates for service , i join my colleague from california in advocating this legislation . however , we must support our troops in accordance with the u.s. constitution and with respect for civil rights and fundamental freedoms that are the rubric of this nation . when the house debated h.r. 3966 , which would allow for the denial of federal funds for educational institutions unless military recruiters are provided access to the campuses of these institutions , i voted `` yes '' on passage of the measure with the understanding that no constitutional contravention would result from its implementation . the resolution that is before the house today , however , is controversial because the final disposition of underlying federal jurisprudence could play a major role clarifying the way we apply constitutional principles to an act of congress . the holding in forum for academic and institutional rights v. rumsfeld tells us that we must be very careful in the way we regulate society so as not to violate fundamental rights . ( 390 f.3d 219 ( 3rd cir . 2004 ) ) . so , mr. speaker , i do support the intent of this legislation because i honor the men and women who serve in our armed services and who sacrifice their lives for us . however , i also support the upholding of the united states constitution and the respect for jurisprudence , and i believe it seriously damages our commitment to the three branches of government to encourage the interference with judicial decisions before a final rendering of a final review by the u.s. supreme court . ",D
"mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . i want to speak certainly in favor of the solomon amendment and remind my colleagues that it does not apply to institutions of higher education that have had a longstanding practice of pacificism based on historic religious grounds , and it exempts federal student financial assistance from termination . but what it does do is allow students to look at career opportunities in the army . and as the chairman of the committee on armed services said , there are so many legal issues involved in the military today and to go beyond that , to let people look at careers in , i would say , intelligence as much as anything , homeland security , there is a great opportunity for students to go into . but we are also seeing so much push-back really from a crowd that is basically anti-american and anti-conservative . indeed , there are so many prejudices against everyday middle-class values on college campuses , and serving in the military and being pro-american just seems to be one of them . students at wells college , for example , were ridiculed by their professors if they supported the war in iraq . at the university of missouri , a professor , a science professor , offered extra credit for students to protest a speech given by conservative activist david horowitz . at the university of richmond , a professor called president bush a moron in his class . and at the university of oregon , students were labeled `` neo-nazi '' for expressing their opinion that trent lott was the victim of a double standard . and examples go on and on . another statistic , the foundation for individual rights in education found that over 90 percent of well-known college campuses have speech codes intended to ban or punish politically incorrect , almost always conservative speech , and that campus funds are unequally distributed to left-wing groups as opposed to conservative groups by a ratio of 50 to one . i think the judicial attack on the solomon amendment is just one of a series of a trend that is against , again , anything that is pro-american , pro-conservative , pro-traditional values . and so i would submit for the record an article that was an opinion in the wall street journal recently and then something on the academic bill of rights that i think also touches into this same subject . the bill would express the continued support of congress for the so-called `` solomon law '' in title 10 , u.s. code , which improves dod 's ability to establish and maintain rotc detachments and to ensure military recruiters have access to college campuses and students that is at least equal in quality and scope to that provided to other employers . the bill would : state congress 's resolve to achieve military personnel readiness through vigorous application of the `` solomon law '' relating to equal access for military recruits to institutions of higher education , and express congress 's commitment to explore all options , including the use of its constitutional power to appropriate funds , to achieve that equal access . express the sense of congress that the executive branch should aggressively challenge any decision impeding or prohibiting the operation of the `` solomon law. '' encourage the executive branch to follow a doctrine of non-acquiescene by not finding a judicial decision affecting one jurisdiction to be binding on other jurisdictions . the so-called `` solomon law , '' section 983 , title 10 , u.s. code , named for its original proponent representative gerald solomon ( r-ny ) , is based on the principle that if a college or university accepts federal funding it must permit military recruiters and/or rotc access to campus and to students . enacted first in 1994 , and added to by congress in 1996 , 1999 and 2002 , and 2004 , the `` solomon law '' prohibits some defense-related and other federal funding from going to colleges and universities that prevent rotc access or military recruiting on campus . the solomon law : ( 1 ) does not apply to institutions of higher education that have a long-standing policy of pacifism based on historical religious grounds ; and , ( 2 ) exempts federal student financial assistance from termination . the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit , on 29 november 2004 , reversed a district court decision , which had upheld the constitutionality of the `` solomon law , '' by ruling that the `` solomon law '' violated the 1st amendment rights of free speech and association held by institutions of higher education . the third circuit remanded the case to the district court to enter a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the `` solomon law. '' the acting solicitor general has announced his intention to petition the supreme court for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the third circuit court . the government also filed a motion on 14 january 2005 with the third circuit court seeking to stay the court 's mandate for a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the `` solomon law '' until the supreme court decides the government 's petition . the third circuit granted the stay on 19 january . h. con . res. 36 , in expressing continued support for equal access of military recruiters to institutions of higher education , makes the following points regarding the `` solomon law '' : under article i , section 8 , of the constitution , congress exclusively has the power to raise and support armies , provide and maintain a navy , and make rules for the government and regulation of the armed forces . military recruiting on university campuses is one of the primary means by which the armed forces obtain highly qualified new military personnel and is an integral , effective and necessary part of overall military recruiting . efforts by colleges and universities to restrict or prohibit military recruiter access will have the harmful effects of increasing federal spending to achieve desired recruiting outcomes and of compromising military readiness and performance . such harm conflicts with federal responsibilities to provide for the nation 's defense . any reduction in the performance by the armed forces amidst the present national emergency declared by the president on september 14 , 2001 , operates against the national interest . the constitution gives congress the power to regulate spending and in that role congress has chosen over time to appropriate funds for a variety of government programs to be provided to institutions of higher learning . however , these funds are not an entitlement to any college or university and can be provided subject to criteria and conditions set by congress . the `` solomon law '' is a legislative safeguard that links federal funding of educational institutions to the willingness of those institutions to abide by a rule of access by military recruiters to campuses and students that is at least equal in quality and scope that is provided to any other employer . for the last several years , a growing number of university law schools and colleges of law have treated military recruiters in ways significantly different from the recruiters of other employers . as a result , military recruiters and the persons they seek to interview have been subjected to various degrees of official and unofficial harassment or ill treatment that is designed to make military recruiting difficult , or to frustrate its objectives . the underlying reason for this differing treatment is opposition to federal law that prohibits military service by openly gay people -- the so-called `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' law . given that opposition , it is imperative that the safeguards that the `` solomon law '' provides not only for military recruiters , but also for rotc , be maintained . without such safeguards , grave harm to military recruiting will result as colleges and universities move to limit or deny access to campuses and students by representatives of the armed forces . academic bill of rights hiring practices for professors faculty hiring is controlled by more senior members of the faculty itself : as conservative faculty forced to keep political views quiet until they achieve tenure . usually hire those who agree with them , creates a perpetual cycle . creates an environment where marxists , post-modernists , etc . can still dominate in academic fields even while their views have been discredited : numbers of liberal professors vs . conservative professors the overall ratio of democrats to republicans at the 32 schools studied was more than 10 to 1 ( 1397 democrats , 134 republicans ) . not a single department at a single one of the 32 schools managed to achieve a reasonable parity between the two main political parties : in the nation at large , registered democrats and republicans are roughly equal in number . the closest any school came to parity was northwestern university -- democrats outnumbered registered republicans by a ratio of 4-1 . other schools : other schools had zero registered republicans : most students probably graduate without ever having a class taught by a professor with a conservative viewpoint . not just a faculty problem but a campus-wide bias for example , the university of pennsylvania , carnegie melon , and cornell could not identify a single republican administrator . in the entire ivy league , there were only 3 republican administrators identified . impact on students remarks belittling conservative ideas convey that these views are not accepted on campus -- grading based on these ideas reinforce this perception . one student called a `` fascist '' for inviting oliver north to campus . university of oregon -- student labeled `` neo-nazi '' for expressing his opinion that trent lott was the victim of a double standard . university of richmond -- professor called president bush a `` moron '' in the classroom . university of missouri in columbia -- professor offered extra credit to protest a speech by david horowitz . students at wells college were ridiculed by professors for their support on iraq war and their views on feminism . `` it did n't take long to see how liberal it was after i came here . the professors and the education i receive is excellent , but the professors seem to use class as a political soapbox , '' -- kristy l. hochenberger , a student at wells college . slogan circulated by biology professor at wells college -- '' lobotomies for republicans : it 's not just a good idea ; it 's the law ! `` . many students conceal what they actually think in order to protect their academic standing -- a reality clearly at odds with the educational mission of the university . nearly all distinguished doctoral programs rely on matching students with professors who have compatible interests . preferential treatment shown to those with similar liberal ideals . campus guests , speech police and commencement speakers campus funds are unequally distributed to leftwing student groups as opposed to groups with conservative agendas by a ratio close to 50 : 1 : these student groups are many times in charge of hiring campus speakers . the foundation for individual rights in education found that over 90 percent of well-known college campuses have speech codes intended to ban and punish politically incorrect , almost always conservative , speech . the ratio of commencement speakers on the left and right was 226-15 , a ratio of over 15 : 1 : commencement speakers are selected through committees composed of administrative staff , faculty , and students . twenty-two of the thirty-two schools surveyed did not have a single republican or conservative commencement speaker in the entire ten years surveyed : six of the remaining schools invited only one republican or conservative each , as compared to 38 liberals or democrats . haverford , swarthmore and ucla , which host multiple speakers every year , did not feature a single republican or conservative speaker as balanced against 54 liberals and democrats . academic bill of rights recognizes that political partisanship by professors is an abuse of students ' academic freedom . designed to take politics out of the university curriculum : does not call for more classics in curriculum , reading lists should provide students with dissenting viewpoints so they may form their own opinions . designed to protect the right of students to `` get an education rather than an indoctrination '' : should not make professors afraid of what they say , we defend professors ' right to say anything and forbids administration from punishing them for their political opinions , professors should always be open to dissenting opinions . unequal funding of student organizations which host guest speakers is unacceptable : calls for pluralism in selection of guest speakers . learning environment hostile to conservatives is wrong . there is a lack of `` intellectual diversity '' within faculties on college campuses : university should be `` inclusive '' to all viewpoints , without it , free exchange of ideas are impaired . it is not our intention to suggest that there should be quotas based on party affiliation in the hiring process at universities : we support removing all politics and political affiliation from the hiring process , it is our purpose to point out the gross imbalance of liberal vs . conservative professors . while nearly all university administrations devote extraordinary resources to defend the principle of diversity in regard to race and gender , none can be said to have shown interest in the diversity of ideas . universities have the privilege of being separate from the society they inhabit : society grants faculty protection from the influence of outside politics , with that privilege comes a responsibility by the faculty to also safeguard the free exchange of ideas . correcting this should be the goal and an integral part of educational policy under the academic bill of rights . wisdom of solomon -- the disgrace of blocking military recruiters from campus do n't ask . do n't tell . having no desire to crash our e-mail server , we 'll save discussion of gays in the military for another day . rather , today 's subject is lawyers in the military . surely americans of all points of view can agree that in an age of guantanamo and abu ghraib , the military can use the best attorneys it can get . so it 's a disgrace that some of the nation 's law schools , objecting to the pentagon 's `` discrimination policies , '' refuse to permit military recruiters to make their pitch on campus , relegating them instead to unofficial off-campus venues . law students pondering their first career move can be wined and dined by fancy firms that set up recruitment tables at campus job fairs , but they have to stroll over to the local day 's inn to seek out the lonely military recruiter . to put it another way , the same liberals who object that the military includes too many lower-class kids wo n't let military recruiters near the schools that contain students who will soon join the upper-class elite . it 's almost enough to make us contemplate restoring the draft , starting with law school students . needless to say , such scholastic shenanigans do n't go down well with congress , which in 1994 passed the solomon amendment , named for the late new york republican , gerald solomon . the law requires schools that receive federal funds to provide equal access to military recruiters . today , the house is scheduled to vote on a resolution brought by alabama republican mike rogers that would restate the house 's support for the solomon amendment . something similar passed the house and senate by overwhelming margins last year and was incorporated into the defense authorization bill . the impetus for mr. rogers 's move is a november ruling by the federal appeals court in philadelphia in favor of a group of law schools and legal scholars that had contested the solomon law . the 2-1 opinion found that the solomon amendment violates the schools ' first amendment rights to free speech and association . next stop is the supreme court , which is expected to take the appeal that the justice department plans to bring . there are many peculiarities to this lawsuit , starting with the fact that the group that brought it -- the forum for academic and institutional rights -- declines to release the names of the 26 law schools and faculties that belong to its coalition . some of the participants ( new york university and georgetown , for example ) have outed themselves since the suit was brought in 2003 , but others steadfastly maintain their own don't-ask-don't-tell policy . in any event , there should be no legal question about congress 's right to put conditions on grants of federal funds to universities . it does this all the time -- including requirements that colleges adhere to certain civil rights and gender standards . with a few exceptions , universities have no trouble going along and courts have no problem letting them . if , as is likely , the supreme court overturns the appeals court decision , that will be the end of it . almost all universities , public and private , take millions of dollars in federal money that would be next to impossible to give up . that 's especially true of the elite schools , both public and private . still , it would be nice to think that the nation 's universities would welcome the military for reasons other than the mercenary . patriotism , perhaps ?

"mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . mr. speaker , here we are at the start of a new year and a new congress and we are considering this bill , surprise , surprise , under a closed rule . once again , the republican majority has decided that thoughtful debate and the ability for members to offer amendments if they so wish is unimportant or simply too much bother . the underlying bill , house concurrent resolution 36 , was introduced yesterday , has not gone to committee , let alone and be reported out of committee , and was being taken up in the committee on rules yesterday just about the time that most members ' planes were touching down in washington . so once again the majority has followed its usual practice to stifle debate , prevent amendments , and ignore normal procedure to push a bill to the house floor ahead of more important issues facing the country . apparently , the republican leadership could not possibly start the new year out by deciding to finally help the more than one million jobless workers who have exhausted their regular unemployment benefits without receiving additional aid . i know the majority does not like to be reminded that we still have the largest number of exhaustees in over 3 decades , but the 109th congress begins still facing this bitter reality and obviously still doing nothing to ease the hardships facing these workers and their families . clearly , the republican majority did not feel it necessary to press the president to get his supplemental request to assist the victims in nations affected by the asian tsunami quickly before the house , so we are not taking that measure up this week . in fact , we are not likely to act on this most urgent matter until march . but a bill exhorting the white house to ignore and overturn proceedings in the federal courts and to press higher education institutions to ignore their own policies prohibiting discrimination , well , that is a bill that gets top billing in the house of representatives today . mr. speaker , in the united states of america discrimination is wrong . period . but here we are right out of the gate with a bill that condones it . let us start with a little history on this bill . in the mid-90s , congress passed legislation to deny defense department funding to colleges and universities that fail to give military recruiters access to their campuses and students . known as the solomon law , that legislation was passed to respond to efforts by several colleges and universities to protest the discriminatory policies of the pentagon against gay men and women . over time , the law was expanded to prohibit funding a university might receive from nearly every federal agency , including the department of health and human services , the department of homeland security , the department of transportation , and the department of labor . last year this house passed a bill that would have expanded that list to include the cia and the national nuclear security administration of the department of energy . mr. speaker , there is an irony here . the congress is holding hostage funds from all of these other federal agencies to prop up discrimination by the pentagon . yet every one of these other federal agencies has full access to recruitment on college campuses . why ? because unlike the department of defense , no other federal agencies have policies that encourage discrimination against gay men and women . all of them have employees on their pay rolls . all of these federal agencies and the u.s. government and the american people benefit from the research and development programs that take place on these campuses , some of it carried out , no doubt , by gay men and women . so , mr. speaker , where does the solomon law stand today ? in november 2003 , a u.s. district court in new jersey upheld the constitutionality of the solomon law , but it also determined that the solomon law does not give the pentagon any basis for asserting , as it has in regulations on implementing the solomon law , that universities and colleges must give military recruiters the same degree of access to campuses and students provided to other employers . in november 2004 , just this past november , the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit overruled part of the new jersey district court 's ruling and found the solomon law to be in violation of the constitution . in an appeal brought by a number of schools , mainly graduate schools of law , the court ruled that colleges and universities had a first amendment right to exclude recruiters whose hiring practices discriminated against homosexuals . the u.s. department of justice now plans to appeal the case to the u.s. supreme court , and it has asked the appeals court to hold off enforcing the nullification of the solomon law until the supreme court decides on whether to take up the case or not . mr. speaker , let me point out another irony in this debate today . there is absolutely no lack of equal access for military recruiters and rotc programs on america 's college campuses . what the pentagon receives is special access , pure and simple . to this day , any other employer , public or private , that fails to meet a school 's nondiscrimination policies is banned from employee recruitment on campuses . so the pentagon receives special access to our colleges and universities . the solomon law is about giving the military a special right to discriminate in a way other employers may not . this sense of congress resolution once again reinforces and promotes the pentagon 's discriminatory policy and practices to the detriment of all other education institutions and federal agencies . it further encourages the federal government in its pursuit to challenge court rulings that have upheld the first amendment rights of our colleges and universities in their efforts to end prejudice and discrimination . mr. speaker , the final irony of this debate you will hear today are the arguments about the need of the military to recruit the best and brightest students that america has to offer . i agree with this need , and the way to get there is for the pentagon to end its policy of discrimination . this would end the conflict between the pentagon and college policies against discrimination and prejudice . the pentagon has kicked out over 26 military linguists who were fluent in arabic or farsi simply because they were homosexual . that is unconscionable while our military men and women are facing a deadly insurgency in iraq and continued violence in afghanistan . in the past 5 years , in the army alone , over 3 , 000 uniformed servicemen and women have been discharged solely because of their sexual orientation . they were munitions experts , linguists , health care workers , infantrymen , tank mechanics , radio operators and active in every field of military endeavor . make no mistake about it , right now gay men and women are in battle in iraq and afghanistan , and they have likely died in combat in iraq and afghanistan . they serve their nation just as they have since the founding of the united states , bravely , patriotically and devotedly , but their superiors do not commend their service . if their sexual orientation is discovered , they are drummed out . mr. speaker , there is no lack of access to for the military on america 's campuses . every university that wants an rotc program has one . according to the wall street journal , more than 52 , 000 college students are enrolled in rotc programs , up from 48 , 000 in 2000 . many credit feelings of patriotism engendered by the september 11 attacks , and it comes as no surprise that military enlistment by college graduates has also increased since the events of september 11 . mr. speaker , we do not need the solomon law . we do not need the bill before us today , and we certainly do not need to continue to insult and assault those very institutions of higher education that are leading the way to end hate and discrimination in america . mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .

"mr. speaker , i insert in the record at this point two articles . one is an editorial from the new york times entitled , `` the price of homophobia. '' another is an associate press story entitled , `` report : number of gay linguists discharged higher than thought. '' the price of homophobia do n't ask , do n't tell -- just scream in frustration : it turns out that 20 of the arabic speakers so vitally needed by the nation have been thrown out of the military since 1998 because they were found to be gay . it is hard to imagine a more wrongheaded rebuff of national priorities . the focus must be on the search for osama bin laden and his terrorist legions , not the closet door . the pentagon 's snooping after potential gays trumps what every investigative agency in the war on terror has admitted is a crucial shortage of effective arabic translators . after the first world trade center attack , in 1993 , government agents revealed an alarming shortage of arabic speakers . key notes , videotapes and a phone call pertaining to the attack were later found in a backlog of untranslated investigative data . the shortage continued right up to and well beyond the 9/11 attacks . three years after the towers were destroyed , the f.b.i. , rife with translation problems , admitted it had an untranslated backlog of 120 , 000 hours of intercepts with potential value about looming threats . at the state department , a study showed that only one in five of the 279 arabic translators were fluent enough to handle the subtleties of the language , with its many regional dialects . the military 's experience is no more encouraging , with intelligence results muddied at times by a rush , as one inquiry put it , to recruit arab convenience store owners and cabdrivers , who could n't handle the task . the military is right to rely more on its language schools , but it can take several years to produce fluent graduates . the folly of using `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy against such precious national resources amounts to comfort for the enemy . when president bush was asked last week by the washington post why osama bin laden had eluded capture , he replied , `` because he 's hiding. '' so is the pentagon -- it 's hiding from reality . report : number of gay linguists discharged higher than thought san francisco ( ap ) -- the number of arabic linguists discharged from the military for violating its `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy was nearly three times as high as previously reported , according to records obtained by an advocacy group . between 1998 and 2004 , the military discharged 20 arabic and six farsi speakers , according to department of defense data obtained by the center for the study of sexual minorities in the military under a freedom of information act request . the military previously confirmed that seven translators who specialized in arabic had been discharged because they were gay . the updated numbers were first reported by the new republic magazine . aaron belkin , the center 's director , said he wants the public to see the real costs of `` do n't ask , do n't tell. '' `` we had a language problem after 9/11 and we still have a language problem , '' belkin said wednesday . the military 's `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy allows gays and lesbians to serve in the military as long as they keep their sexual orientation private and do not engage in homosexual acts . but belkin and other advocates say such a policy endangers national security at a time u.s. intelligence agencies and the military say they do n't have enough arabic speakers . `` the military is placing homophobia ahead of national security , '' said steve ralls , spokesman for the servicemembers legal defense network , a nonprofit group which advocates for the rights of gay military members . `` it 's appalling that in the weeks leading up to 9/11 messages were coming in waiting to be translated ... .. and at the same time they were firing people who could 've done that job. '' but others , like elaine donnelly of the center for military readiness , a conservative advocacy group that opposes gays serving in the military , said the discharged linguists never should have been accepted at the elite defense language institute in monterey in the first place . `` resources unfortunately were used to train young people who were not eligible to be in the military , '' she said . `` we need to recruit people who are eligible to serve. '' in the fiscal year ended oct . 31 , 2004 , 543 arabic linguists and 166 farsi linguists graduated from their 63-week courses , according to a dli spokesman . that was up from 377 and 139 , respectively , in the previous year , reflecting the military 's increased need for translators in iraq . experts have identified the shortage of arabic linguists as contributing to the government 's failure to predict the sept . 11 attacks . the independent sept . 11 commission made similar conclusions . the government `` lacked sufficient translators proficient in arabic and other key languages '' to adequately prepare itself against future strikes , the report said . `` it used to be this was seen as a gay rights issue , but now it 's clearly a national security issue , '' said nathaniel frank , a senior research fellow at the center for study of sexual minorities in the military at the university of california , santa barbara . ian finkenbinder , a u.s. army arabic linguist who graduated from the defense language institute in 2002 , was discharged from the military last month after announcing to his superiors that he 's gay . finkenbinder , who said his close friends in the army already knew he was gay , served eight months in iraq and was about to return for a second tour when he made the revelation official . `` i looked at myself and said , `are you willing to go to war with an institution that wo n't recognize that you have the right to live as you want to , ' `` said finkenbinder , 22 , who now lives in baltimore , md . `` it just got to be tiresome to deal with that -- to constantly have such a significant part of your life under scrutiny. '' finkenbinder said his commander was upset to let him go because his arabic proficiency was at the highest possible for a nonnative speaker . the servicemembers legal defense network last month sued the government on behalf of 12 gay former military members seeking reinstatement . they 're seeking to overturn `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' alleging it violates their constitutional rights . mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 .

"i thank my good friend for yielding me this time . mr. speaker , i rise today in support of equal campus access for our military recruiters . recently , a group calling itself freedom for academic and institutional rights , fair , has decided that they disagree with what our military stands for ; and , because of this , they have decided that the military no longer deserves access to our nation 's institutions of higher learning . they claim that granting military recruiters equal access to campuses would promote only a pro-military viewpoint and a pro-military recruiting message . this is simply not true . the government is not asking campuses across america to endorse the war on terror , the president 's policy or anything to do with the military . all we are asking for is that the military be afforded the exact same access as other organizations to the student body . that is it . that is all . those who argue that giving equal access somehow constitutes an endorsement of the military are just plain wrong . does giving equal access to other groups mean that each institution agrees with every idea that that organization may have ? of course not . i really think it is ridiculous to argue that point , but fair is arguing just that . it is in everyone 's interest to ensure that young people receive information , including military options , so they can make informed choices about their future after they finish their education . just because a school disagrees with a career in the military , does that give them the right to deny information about that particular career to someone who might want to sign up ? is it right to deny access because you disagree with what someone says ? how is that in keeping with the first amendment to the constitution ? the position that fair and others have taken is nothing more than thinly veiled hypocrisy . they are masking their obvious hatred of our nation 's military by hiding behind the first amendment . i think it is wrong . i am not going to sit idly by while this so-called fair group trashes our military . the constitution in article 1 , section 8 , states that congress shall have the power to raise and support armies , provide and maintain a navy and make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces . it does not say that activist judges and institutions of higher education have the right to prevent congress from going about its duty to raise and support the armed forces of these united states . were the members of the fair not aware that we were at war and that a state of national emergency has existed in this country since september 11 of 2001 ? i am sure they are happy to enjoy the rights afforded to them by the first amendment , but who allows them those rights ? perhaps they should reread the old poem to a soldier : `` it is the soldier , not the reporter , who has given us freedom of the press . `` it is the soldier , not the poet , who has given us freedom of speech . `` it is the soldier , not the campus organizer , who gives us freedom to demonstrate . `` it is the soldier who salutes the flag , who serves beneath the flag and whose coffin is draped by the flag who allows the protester to burn the flag.

"mr. speaker , this resolution would have us believe that a grave threat is presented to the security of this nation by the policy of some institutions of higher learning to bar military recruiters from their campus because of the discrimination against gay and lesbian people by the military . but that , mr. speaker , is not the threat to our national security . the threat to our national security is the policy of the military to refuse to use the talents and the abilities of gay people in defending our country . one of the biggest problems we have in iraq now is the shortage of people who know how to translate intelligence documents written in arabic and farsi , and yet they are dismissing linguists who can translate these documents for our use to save the lives of our troops because they are gay . this is insanity . our troops are paying with their lives because of the bigotry that this congress has mandated on the military , number one . even that is not the real issue presented by this resolution . the real issue presented by this resolution has to do with free speech and association . private universities , private institutions have chosen to say , as part of their free speech , that they do not want on their campus recruiters from any organization , the military , any private company , anybody else , that discriminates against gay people and lesbian people ; that engages in an unacceptable , to them , form of discrimination . it is not a question , as this resolution says , of equal access to military recruiters . all people , recruiters from all institutions that discriminate are barred from these campuses . we should not have passed the bill that we did , but we passed a bill to say that , if they do that , if a private institution bars military recruiters and other recruiters on an equal basis , we will withhold federal funds . the third circuit court of appeals says that is a violation of the first amendment . this resolution says who cares what the courts say . we do not care about the first amendment . we do not care about the courts . we know better . we encourage the executive branch to follow the doctrine of non-acquiescence and not find a decision affecting one jurisdiction to be binding on another jurisdiction . that is not the way we ought to legislate . this decision was decided by the third circuit court of appeals . the executive branch is going to appeal to the united states supreme court . let it appeal . let us see what the supreme court says , if they accept the case . the courts have to defend our liberties . it is the province of the courts , not of the congress , to declare what the constitution means . our liberties , the bill of rights , are protected from the majority . you never have to protect the majority from itself . you have to protect unpopular minorities . that is why we have a bill of rights and that is why we have the courts to enforce them . for congress to come in and say the court is wrong and the executive should not enforce the order of the court is to show a disdain for the rule of law and a disdain for the spirit of liberty for which we are fighting in iraq and for which our armed forces exists in the first place . this resolution ought to be defeated on its merits . ",D
"mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of h. con . res. 36 . this resolution expresses the continued support of congress for the so-called solomon law , a critical piece of legislation originally passed in 1994 which has helped ensure that military recruiters have equal access on our nation 's campuses . we are debating this resolution today only because of a recent court decision that wrongfully struck down the solomon law . in november of last year , a closely divided u.s. third circuit court of appeals ruled that the solomon law violates first amendment rights to free speech and association . the court sided with the plaintiff arguing that `` the solomon amendment requires law schools to express a message that is incompatible with their educational objectives , and no compelling governmental interest has been shown to deny this freedom. '' mr. speaker , i can not disagree more with this assessment . in our post-9/11 world , our nation 's military deserves , at least the same access to institutions of higher education that any other major employer might enjoy . this is certainly a modest and i believe a reasonable request , especially if the college or university accepts federal funds . this is not about infringing free speech ; it is about ensuring our military has access to our nation 's best and brightest at a time when we face enormous challenges abroad . this resolution expresses the continued support of congress for the solomon law and would help ensure that military recruiters continue to have access to college campuses and students that is at least equal in quality and scope as that provided to any other employer . this resolution would reaffirm the commitment of congress to explore all options , including the use of its constitutional power to appropriate funds to achieve that equal access . in adopting this resolution , we would also be urging the executive branch to aggressively challenge any decision impeding or prohibiting the operation of the solomon law . also , we would be encouraging the executive branch to follow a doctrine of nonacquiescence by not finding a judicial decision affecting one jurisdiction to be binding on any other jurisdiction . mr. speaker , as we debate this resolution , it is important for us to remember that the solomon law and its legislative updates were not designed as one-size-fits-all mandates from washington . in fact , the law is very flexible , and it fits the needs of nearly every public-funded institution in the country . for example , the solomon law does not apply to colleges or universities that have a long-standing policy of pacifism based on historical religious grounds , nor does it affect any federal student aid or financial assistance . of course , as those of us who are here debating this issue are aware , this is not the first challenge to this law . prior to the november circuit court decision , on repeated occasions lower courts have consistently upheld the constitutionality of the solomon law , arguing that it does not infringe on any institution 's right to free speech or association . while this recent court decision is unfortunate , it is not the end to the solomon law . a bipartisan vote here today in support of this legislation will help send a clear message to our courts that our military recruiters deserve equal access on all of our campuses . i thank the gentleman from california ( mr. hunter ) xz4001910 for his ongoing efforts on this issue , and i thank the gentleman from minnesota ( mr. kline ) xz4002240 for managing this legislation .

"i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . mr. speaker , i am proud to stand here in support of this resolution , a very important resolution introduced by the gentleman from alabama ( mr. rogers ) xz4003411 . i think we are at a critical period of time in this nation 's history , and it comes a couple of days after one of the more significant , what you would call victories or symbols of what the american military presence is about and what its results are . that is , that we pride ourselves in having the best educated , the best trained , the best quality of people serving in all sorts of branches , in all sorts of jobs in the united states military ; and at a time when the world needs this the most from us , it is very important that we maintain that quality . i heard the prior speaker talk about the fact that this may be a dangerous place and there are all sorts of other political ideas that may be at play where you could put a recruiter on a campus or not . what i would simply say is that that is not the same argument as here . this is an argument of fairness and equity . it is an argument that says that just because somebody 's political philosophy is counter to the idea that we want to have a strong military presence in this nation , those school administrators , who i think are way off the board in terms of their left-wing views and their antimilitary approach , ought not to be able to ban college military recruiters from doing their job because it is in the national interest that we do it . it is really in the world 's interest . so i am here to support this resolution and say that what the third circuit did last november again represents the judiciary trying to legislate where it ought not to do it . my predecessor , gerry solomon , first introduced this amendment many years back . it was that amendment that has been struck down . i strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution and recognizing that what we do for the private sector in allowing them to put recruiters in law schools or on any college campus ought to be the same that we do for something so important and so critical as the recruitment of the best and the brightest into our military forces . i urge all of my colleagues to strongly support this resolution .

"mr. speaker , first i thank the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. butterfield ) xz4006160 for yielding me this time to speak , time to speak in opposition to h. con . res. 36 . mr. speaker , last november a federal court said the federal government can not take away a university 's funding simply because the school refuses to exempt the u.s. military from its policy , meaning the university 's policy , and that on-campus recruiters not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation . today we are debating a resolution in support of the solomon amendment . if this house of representatives votes to support that resolution , we will be putting the congress on record as supporting absolute senseless discrimination . the resolution says it is about equal access for military recruiters at institutions of higher education . but , in reality , it is about allowing the military to avoid the consequences of discrimination , the same consequences that any other employer would have to face if it discriminated . many say , and you heard it today , that our national security requires the military to engage in this discrimination , but the facts just do not support it . the court said that the government failed to produce , and i quote , `` a shred of evidence '' that the solomon amendment helps military recruiting , and even suggested that the hostility that the amendment causes may hurt recruiting . it was reported in last month that since 1998 , the military has discharged 20 fluent arabic speakers and six fluent farsi speakers under its `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy . these are students that the military claims to be desperate to recruit . no , mr. speaker , this resolution is not about military recruiting or national security . plain and simple , it is about punishing universities for exercising their first amendment right to oppose discrimination against gays and lesbians ; and i encourage my colleagues , stand up for the constitution , oppose this resolution .

"mr. speaker , i rise in support of the amendment today out of a bit of a sense of confusion as to why we really need to revisit this issue one more time . it is odd that in a nation at war that institutions of higher learning would take steps to limit the army and the navy , the marine corps , coast guard and other services ' access to their students . i wonder what they are afraid of as to why they would take this particular position . they pride themselves on having the brightest in america at their universities , particularly the ones in question . as an aside , i was at a university in january , excuse me , in november , at freshman orientation and saw a couple of co-eds walking across campus that obviously have impaired reading skills because they were both smoking . nevertheless , i wonder what they are afraid of . why are they afraid of the message of serving one 's country , of doing one 's duty . we can argue that the federal government should or should not be in a lot of different areas , but clearly national defense and raising an army is a mission of our founding fathers that none of us would argue with . i guess the point i would like to make is that if these colleges and universities feel so strongly that their students should not participate in our military , then let us do it with honor and voluntarily turn back the federal funding that supports many of the programs that they support through their universities . i would call on them and if they are really serious about limiting this , they are afraid of what our recruiters might say , that our recruiters might ask their young men and women to serve their country , to place their lives on the line , as many of the men and women who today serve our country in those armed forces are doing every day in iraq and afghanistan and other places around the world that we do not necessarily know about , but nevertheless they are serving , why they are afraid of this message ? why they do not think their students should have access to that ? i rise in support of this resolution and would ask those universities that feel strongly about this to voluntarily send back all the federal funding that they are currently getting and allow us to use those dollars in universities that are a little more in line with the issues that we are talking about today .

"mr. chairman , i rise in strong opposition of this bill . it does nothing to make america safer . it is simply anti-immigrant legislation placed under the mask of homeland security . the bill will prevent states from giving licenses to undocumented immigrants . it will not prevent terrorists from obtaining identification forms . all of the 9/11 hijackers were in this country legally . in fact , allowing immigrants to have licenses actually improves homeland security by allowing our government to track who is in our borders . this bill will also raise insurmountable hurdles for refugees seeking asylum and will deport victims of persecution into the hands of their persecutors . proponents of this provision claim that we need to tighten asylum laws , yet , they can not pinpoint a single terrorist given asylum in the united states . this bill will also require the completion of a fence on the mexican border , waiving environmental laws in california . this fence is a complete waste of money and resources . people will go over it , under it and around it to enter our country . our immigration system is a broken system that needs to be fixed . we need reform that provides hardworking people of good character with a real path towards citizenship . but this bill is simply a band-aid on the problem that will not provide lasting reform .

"mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my colleague from new york . it boggles my mind that the united states provides any funding to the saudi kingdom . with all of its oil and all of its wealth , it is nothing short of insanity . it is no secret , in spite of what the last speaker said , that the saudi regime is a leading exporter of terrorism worldwide ; it is a leading financier of terrorism worldwide . the thought that one cent of american money is being spent in saudi arabia is an insult to every american taxpayer . the saudis continue to declare to the world that they are a progressive-thinking nation and they are our partners in the global war on terrorism . that is what their pr firm says , anyway . nothing could be further from the truth . this is our partner in peace ? fifteen of the 19 hijackers were saudi nationals . that did not happen by accident . this is the same saudi arabia that has the worst record for religious tolerance on the planet , the same saudi arabia that exudes racism and anti-semitic hatred . our partners in peace ? how shameful for the united states . the saudis claim that they are prosecuting terrorists . who are they kidding ? saudi efforts to prosecute terrorists are inept at best and more accurately nonexistent . if they are doing anything in lebanon , it is for themselves , not for the people of the united states of america . i ask everyone to support the weiner amendment . ",D
"mr. speaker , i thank very much my friend from florida for yielding me this time . mr. speaker , my opposition to h.r. 418 is for two reasons , one that is broader in the context of the problems we face , and one is specific to asylum . i am just going to address the former on the issue of debating essentially an unobjectionable rule that simply allows for general debate and urge opposition on that ground alone . the placement of the bill on this agenda at this particular time is a manifestation of the triumph of ideology over common sense , and it is a response to spasms of anger rather than a reflection of sober analysis . contrary to the arguments of the republicans , including my friend , the chairman of the committee , including the majority leader of this house , the issues of immigration reform , border security , national security , and public safety are inextricably linked . but we hear not one word or hint of any intention on the part of the majority in this house , in contrast with both the president and the leadership in the senate , of ever dealing with the fundamental issue . our immigration system is broken . the results of that breakdown endanger american security . between 8 and 14 million people are in this country without legal status . they live in our shadows . they utilize false documents . their true identity is unknown . for the most part , they work and pay taxes . and , except for their illegal status , they observe our laws . they provide the overwhelming proportion of the workforce in critical industries . they are located throughout the country and they are subject to all kinds of exploitation , but for a variety of reasons , they have no intention of leaving this country . a few among them , without doubt , a few among them mean harm to americans and are plotting terrorist acts . the status quo is simply intolerable . but where the proponents of this bill are so wrong , so self-defeating , is in thinking that piecemeal fixes like this have anything to do with protecting americans against those who are plotting to harm us . only a comprehensive approach that deals with issues like defense , like a nonforgeable identifier , a nonforgeable social security card , effective enforcement , and coming to terms with the status of the 8 to 14 million people who are working and linked to working and have committed no other crimes , getting them out of the shadows so we can know who they are , we can fingerprint them and match them to watch lists . that is the only way to deal with the problem . look at our situation . the majority leader says `` this bill is a border security bill . it is a homeland security bill . immigration reform is a completely different subject. '' the chairman of our committee , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , says `` it is to everybody 's best interest to separate out the security questions from the immigration questions. '' but you can not . president bush knows that . he realizes that these gentlemen are wrong , that this analysis is wrong , that this piecemeal approach is not going to do the job ; and he has repeatedly called for a comprehensive reform of our immigration system because `` the current system results in diverting homeland security resources to chasing people who are here because they want to put food on their table . they take resources away from catching criminals and terrorists. '' that is the president . senator cornyn , the new chairman of the subcommittee on immigration and claims , no liberal he , realizes that the strategy of the gentleman from wisconsin is a mistake . he said it pretty specifically , `` i do n't believe we can deal with border security and homeland security without dealing with immigration reform. '' aside from the asylum provisions , i do not have any heartburn about these , of course , in a world where we have fixed the system so it does not have 8 to 14 million people here out of status , illegally , undocumented , and people who should not get driver 's licenses . but this will not solve the problem . there will be people who are not going to be here legally , who will have driver 's licenses after this bill passes , and there will be people with false ids after this bill passes ; and you will not have dealt with the fundamental issue . for that reason , more than any other , although the fundamental change of the asylum system that is going to keep people fleeing persecution from finding their historic asylum in this country , without dealing anything with terrorists who are already eligible for asylum , is another reason to oppose this bill , and i urge opposition on it . ",D
"mr. speaker , what i would have asked the gentleman from georgia ( mr. gingrey ) xz4001510 , had he been willing to yield some time , was to show me where in the 9/11 report it makes any reference to making any of the changes in the asylum law that are being proposed by the majority here in this bill . there is no reference to that whatsoever , because the 9/11 commission knew that terrorists and threats to national security can not get asylum . instead , the majority , because it does not agree with the commission on religious freedom , because it does not accept fundamental traditions of people who have a well-founded fear of persecution based on their political attitudes or their ethnicity or their religion or their gender , they do not want to make sure they are able to get asylum , they dump a whole bunch of things that have nothing to do with terrorism in here , not recommended by the 9/11 commission report , and then try to claim we are simply fulfilling the 9/11 commission recommendations . ",D
"mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me time . mr. speaker , section 101 , the asylum provisions , are flawed . existing law exempts and prohibits terrorists or threats to national security or those who the government can prove through secret evidence are threats to national security from getting asylum . that is existing law . this self-executing rule , which allows amendments which have never been considered by any committee or heard through hearing or markup , do several dangerous things . section 101 encourages asylum officers and immigration judges to deny an asylum claim simply because the applicant was able to recall or recount information later in the process that she did not mention when she was initially encountered by immigration officers . the amendment included in the rule would expand that to include consistency on matters that are entirely relevant to the basis of the claim for asylum . it would mean that a woman who has been subjected to gang rape by government armed forces in her country who is too afraid or ashamed to tell the fact to the armed male immigration officer she first encounters at the airport in the united states could , if she tells the story later on in the process , be denied asylum simply because she was too afraid or too ashamed to tell the story to the first person she encountered . now , under the amendment , this woman could be denied asylum because she can not recall facts that are irrelevant to establishing her need from protection , her high school graduation date , for example . in a system where we rely on translations and statements taken from people in crisis , this is a very change in the law . it is a fundamental challenge to the whole concept of the immigration judge considering all things coming into the record . the one thing i know is if section 101 becomes law , people with a well-founded fear of persecution , as a result of these changes , will be denied asylum , there will be no effort whatsoever to enhance our efforts to protect this country against terrorism , but we will have struck a fundamental blow against a tradition which i think is very important to maintain in this country and that is that we are a haven for refugees from persecution for political , ethnic , religious , gender reasons . i urge a `` no '' vote on the rule and a `` no '' vote on the bill . even more troubling is a fact discussed in a report released this week by the u.s. commission on international religious freedom . often immigration judges determine that an applicant is not credible because their statement at the airport was inconsistent with later statements because later statements included more detail . the problem with that logic is that when an asylum applicant is interviewed in inspections , the interview stops at the moment that the person establishes a fear of persecution . they are not invited to provide more detail until a later credible fear interview . in other words , the applicant is n't the reason the details are not included . this bill would codify this preposterous failure of the immigration judges ' logic in these cases . section 101 also would encourage asylum officers and immigration judges to deny an asylum claim because of perceived problems with an applicant 's demeanor . this would mean that a woman subjected to persecution by the taliban who has been taught that she should not make eye contact with a man could be denied asylum simply because she did not make eye contact with the male immigration officer interviewing her . furthermore , it is quite common for torture survivors suffering from post-traumatic stress to exhibit characteristics in their demeanor such as lack of eye contact , the inability to recall simple details that to an untrained person may appear to be symptoms of lying . for example , fauyiza kassindja , a young togolese woman who fled female genital mutilation ( fgm ) , would have been denied asylum under this standard with little chance of getting that determination reversed on appeal . under current law , the board of immigration appeals rightly reversed the immigration judge 's credibility finding in her case , and that decision has helped protect other women fleeing fgm . section 101 would encourage asylum officers and immigration judges to deny an asylum claim when the applicant can not provide corroborating evidence of their claims if the officer , in his unreviewable discretion , believes that the applicant should be able to provide such evidence . this disproportionately harms applicants who are detained and/or lack counsel . relatedly , h.r. 418 would constrain judicial review of a denial of asylum based on an applicant 's failure to provide corroborating evidence . section 101 would require some asylum applicants to prove not only that they are refugees , but also prove their persecutors ' central reason . the additional burden on asylum applicants created by this provision is impermissible under the international law , including the u.n . convention on refugees to which the united states is a signatory . to meet the standard set forth in the convention , it is sufficient to show persecution is motivated in part by one of the prohibited grounds . asking a refugee or asylum applicant to parse his persecutor 's motivations so finely as to distill the `` central reason '' or `` central reason '' is asking asylum the proponents of section 101 assert that we must enact this section in order to prevent terrorists from gaining asylum . my friends who are the authors of this provision are in error , however , in this assertion . i have been informed by my staff that while several persons with terrorist connections have applied for asylum over the years , the department of homeland security has not found a single terrorist has ever been granted asylum in the united states . this is because , first , current law appropriately makes terrorists ineligible for asylum , and second , the standard for granting asylum is already so high that applicants are subjected to intense scrutiny before a decision on their claims is made . while the united states has not , as far as the department of homeland security knows , ever granted asylum to a terrorist , there was , indeed , a problem more than a decade ago whereby persons could apply for asylum and then be paroled into the united states while their claims were pending . that is no longer possible today . a person who applies for asylum today is held in detention until an investigation is made on the credibility of their claim and on whether they pose a security risk to the united states . in conclusion , mr. speaker , the consequences for asylum seekers to enactment of section 101 could be catastrophic . the new standards could make it far more difficult for legitimate asylum seekers to prove their claims . after all , would an asylum officer in 1938 have found jews ' claims of being thrown into the death camps and ovens of nazi germany credible ? would the victims of the nazi death camps have been able to present corroboration of the specific facts asserting their claims ? if a bosnian woman who has faced rape at the hands of government agents as a systematic form of persecution is ashamed or afraid to relate her rapes in her initial interviews , should that be an automatic ground to find her not credible ? it is unclear what really motivated the drafters of h.r. 418 to put section 101 into this measure . two things are clear , however : the provision has absolutely nothing to do with terrorism , and it was not recommended by the 9/11 commission . let me repeat that , because yesterday a member of the majority claimed this bill was simply enacting recommendations of the commission . the chairman and vice chairman of the 9/11 commission have clearly and specifically rejected that these asylum provisions are supported by their recommendations . we should consider changes to our asylum laws in a sober and reflective manner after hearings , subcommittee consideration , and full committee consideration . neither section 101 of h.r. 418 nor any of the other provisions of this bill had a single hearing or markup . i urge my colleagues to stand against this rule and if the rule is not defeated , i implore you to support the amendment that will be offered later today to strike section 101 in its entirety .

"mr. chairman , i rise today in strong support of h.r. 418 , the real id act . as a member of the congressional immigration reform caucus , i join with my colleagues to raise attention to the serious flaws in our immigration system which leave our nation exposed to potential threats . the 9/11 commission made several recommendations which were not enacted as part of the national intelligence reform act of 2004 ( public law 108-458 ) , including provisions to strengthen identification document standards and to secure our borders . the commission specifically recommended that the federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification such as driver 's licenses . in addition , the commission recommended the department of homeland security 's , dhs , completion of a biometric entry-exit screening system and the improvement of u.s. border security standards for travel and border crossing . i was disappointed that the conference committee on the intelligence reform bill opted to remove the immigration-related provisions approved by the house during its consideration of h.r. 10 last fall . i commend house leadership for honoring the commitment made to chairman sensenbrenner to allow the consideration of the bill we have before us today . we have a real opportunity to adopt meaningful reforms to improve our immigration system . h.r. 418 establishes strict proof of identity for all applicants for state-issued driver 's licenses and identification documents . this bill serves to protect the integrity of our immigration laws by requiring states , in effect , to confirm lawful immigration status or disclose the lack of confirming identification on the face of cards issued . h.r. 418 also makes aliens deportable for terrorism-related offenses to the same extent that they would be inadmissible for the same grounds . if nothing else , our immigration system must prevent potential terrorists from entering the united states . we would not be exercising our responsibility to protect national security if we were to allow our immigration system to be exploited by those malevolent individuals who seek to destroy americans and our way of life . mr. chairman , there are many flaws in our immigration system which need to be fixed . h.r. 418 does not address them all , but it does represent a good step forward in discouraging lawbreaking by those who would choose to exploit our welcoming nature . as a cosponsor of the real id act , i urge my colleagues to improve our nation 's security and strengthen our immigration laws by voting for h.r. 418 . ",R
"mr. chairman , our committee chairman is exactly right ; we can go to page 384 in the 9/11 commission report . and i encourage all of my constituents to do this , look at this : `` for terrorists , travel documents are as important as weapons. '' and what is the number one travel document ? it is a driver 's license . it is a huge gaping hole that we have . that is why it is imperative that we pass the real id act today and we set a national standard . maybe that is just too much common sense for some of my friends that do not want us to do that , but if someone is going to use a travel document as a driver 's license and use it as a way to circumvent our laws and harm our citizens , then it is imperative that we close that loophole . having standards that all the states would follow is a great way to close that loophole . i would encourage my colleagues to support the real id act . i thank the gentleman from virginia ( chairman tom davis ) for his good work on this issue , and i encourage our constituents to read this report and see the importance of the actions that we are taking today . ",R
"mr. chairman , i appreciate the gentlewoman 's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this , and i agree with her very strongly . make no mistake , our side of the aisle is supportive of this legislation . we want to work with the state and local authorities first to do it right . these are the people who feel these concerns every bit as strongly as members of congress . in fact , they are on the line every day providing for the safety and security of our constituents in a much more immediate sense than we are . do not be afraid to work with them . but with all due respect to the gentlewoman from the district of columbia , i have one other provision that deeply offends me as a former elected official , as a member of this body and somebody who believes in checks and balances . i look at section 102 . i wish that it were buried in the legislation , but it is not . it is right here in the beginning . if this provision , the waiver of all laws necessary for quote improvements of barriers at the border was to become law , the secretary of homeland security could give a contract to his political cronies that had no safety standards , using 12-year-old illegal immigrants to do the labor , run it through the site of a native american burial ground , kill bald eagles in the process , and pollute the drinking water of neighboring communities . and under the provisions of this act , no member of congress , no citizen could do anything about it because you waive all judicial review . now , bear in mind you are giving this authority to the head of homeland security , hardly a paragon of sensitivity and efficiency . anybody who stands in those lines week after week or watches the bizarre color-coded warning system knows that that is hardly the exemplar . security at the borders is important ; and if somebody has a problem with building a security fence , by all means , congress should deal with it . but as far as i know , no committee has been called upon to do that yet . there are important waiver provisions that are available . but waiving all laws for construction is an inappropriate decision . and with all due respect , it is a dangerous precedent that anybody on either side of the aisle should be deeply offended by . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield to nobody my concern that this bill has regarding the environment , but that is not the point . we have already had our colleague , the gentleman from california ( mr. duncan ) xz4001160 , talk about how we passed specific legislation signed by president clinton that suspended the endangered species act . what we are talking about here is far beyond this . it is talking about suspending all laws , health , safety , immigration , payment for private property . all laws , not the environment . my colleagues would be creating not a couple of miles of exception to finish a fence , but you would be creating a zone 7 , 514 miles long under the terms of this bill , 5 , 500 in canada , almost 2 , 000 with the border of mexico , where all laws are suspended in the vicinity of the barrier . my colleagues have no idea how much land they are exempting from compensation . mr. chairman , there are only 11 , 751 people who have been privileged to serve in this chamber . i do not think any of them have ever been asked to vote on anything more irresponsible . it is a terrible precedent , unnecessary , and i urge its defeat . ",D
"mr. chairman , today 's bill would not be nearly as flawed or controversial if it had the benefit of going through the committee process . unfortunately , we are faced with costly legislation that overturns states rights and does little to address the problems of our immigration system or to protect americans from another terrorist attack . instead , this bill places enormous regulatory and financial burdens on state governments and makes department of motor vehicles ( dmv ) employees de facto immigration officers . this policy promises to be ineffective as there are approximately 70 different kinds of immigration related documents issued by the federal government . this bill will not deter illegal immigration ; it will probably mean illegal immigrants will drive without licenses . in addition , in order to complete three miles of a border fence near san diego , section 102 of this bill suspends all laws , from public health and labor to the environment and property compensation . in fact , all barriers and roads along 7 , 514 miles of u.s. borders would be exempt from all laws . one person in the department of homeland security would be above the law without any judicial appeal or remedy . this is unprecedented . some of the environmental laws waived would include the noise control act , the clean water act , the farmland protection policy act , and the bald eagle act . in addition to being bad public policy , this exemption is unnecessary , as most of these laws have security exemptions already written into them . this legislation will not make us safer or reduce illegal immigration . in the end , it is hard to imagine a more dangerous precedent . ",D
"mr. chairman , i move to strike the requisite number of words . i am troubled by the amendment that we have before us today . there is , i think , a wide range of opinion that is available for us to debate the merits of a wide range of things in this bill . and i appreciate that people are coming forward in good spirit . but i appreciate the comment of the gentleman from arizona . it was , i want to say , i do not want to say it was my privilege , but i had the opportunity to spend time after the tsunami a couple of weeks after it hit with a bipartisan delegation led by the gentleman from iowa ( mr. leach ) xz4002360 , senator brownback , touring the area . i assure you that the testimony about the devastation is , if anything , understated . the pictures that we saw on cnn did not do justice . but i was struck by the impact of the generosity that was shown by americans in uniform , civilian employees , members of ngos who were there . there was some bad publicity initially , surrounding what appeared to be a lack of compassion on the part of the united states with its initial response . but that never interfered in terms of the publicity with the work that was done by the united states and our agencies . we built amazing goodwill for this country while we helped these traumatized areas heal . i think what has been offered by the president , by the committee , is the least that we can do . it will pay dividends many times over . i think that it would be unfortunate even to bring this proposal to a vote . it is sending the wrong signal about the united states ' intention . we are certainly , on a per capita basis , not giving more than australia , scandinavia , germany . for us to indicate that there is a sense here could only be interpreted as our being callous and unfeeling , i think , is the wrong message to send to these people in these traumatized countries . i think it is the wrong thing to send to the international community . i will say , mr. chairman , in the course of the visit , i had people who were americans in business , people from the ngo communities , foreign parliamentarians , all talking about the damaged relationship that the united states has , the image that we have in this region , and how amazing they felt the progress was being made by the work that was being done by our country . this amendment and any support for it , i think , is sending the wrong signal . and i strongly urge its rejection . i sincerely hope that it is rejected , if necessary , on a voice vote , if not withdrawn . but i hope people make no mistake about how people are watching our actions for the signals we send around the world . ",D
"mr. chairman , i reluctantly voted against this supplemental , not because there are n't many important items included in it , but because a `` no '' vote is one of the few things in my power to signal my deep opposition to the administration 's policy in iraq . at its core , this bill gives too much money to the wrong people to do the wrong thing . as i made clear from the beginning of this war the administration continues to have no plan for success in iraq . they have no blueprint for winning the peace and have not even adequately protected our troops in harm 's way . i fully support the assistance to the tsunami-affected region , and hope it will be used wisely for recovery , reconstruction , and mitigation of future disasters . while we can not prevent natural events such as floods , mudslides , volcanic eruptions , earthquakes , or tsunamis , we can reduce or mitigate their devastating impacts by helping communities to rebuild in safer locations , construct sturdier dwellings , and enhance natural ecosystems that mitigate the impact of these natural disasters . i am pleased to see that there is funding to provide additional armor for our troops and vehicles in iraq . i hope that they will use the funding provided by congress to give our troops the protection that they need . an amendment that i offered with mr. markey to prohibit funds for torture and for sending detainees to countries that practice torture passed . the use of torture and rendition is morally reprehensible , puts americans at risk , is a poor way to obtain reliable information in our fight against terrorism , and sets back the cause of democracy . this is the very least that we can do as congress continues to abdicate its responsibility to investigate this horrific aspect of administration policy . regardless of the merits , everyone should be troubled by the use of supplemental legislation to pay for regular military action in iraq and afghanistan . funding these operations outside of the regular budgeting process limits our ability for effective oversight and distorts the true budget picture . the rules committee burdened this legislation with all the flaws of h.r. 418 , the `` real id act , '' which , among other things , placed the entire 7 , 514 mile border completely outside all legal protections . this is perhaps the most damaging single precedent since i 've been in congress . ",D
"mr. speaker , this appropriations bill contains much crucial funding , most importantly money to provide additional armor for our troops and vehicles in iraq and electronic jammers to protect them from roadside bombs . while i strongly support this funding , i am disappointed that i must vote `` no '' on this bill . we have a responsibility to the men and women who we send into harm 's way as members of the united states armed forces . it is because of my desire to support our troops that i continue to insist that the administration develop a plan to win the peace in iraq and , to the best of our capability , protect the troops as they go about their mission . i believe that congress must hold the administration to the highest standards when the lives of our service personnel are at risk . a `` no '' vote is one of the few ways i have to protest the continued abdication of this responsibility by the highest levels of the bush administration . one positive part of this legislation is an amendment that i offered during house consideration with mr. markey to prohibit funds for torture and for sending detainees to countries that practice torture , which was carried into this conference report . the use of torture and rendition is morally reprehensible , puts americans at risk , is a poor way to obtain reliable information in our fight against terrorism , and sets back the cause of democracy . this is the very least that we can do as congress continues to abdicate its responsibility to investigate this horrific aspect of administration policy . perhaps most disappointing , this legislation also continues to be burdened with all the flaws of h.r. 418 , the `` real id act , '' which , among other things , placed the entire 7 , 514 mile border completely outside all legal protections . this is perhaps the single most damaging precedent since i 've been in congress . do we really want to be giving this responsibility to the department of homeland security , which has not been a paragon of efficiency and sensitivity during its three years of existence ? some of the environmental laws waived by this provision include : the noise control act , the clean water act , the farmland protection policy act , and the bald eagle act . this is not only bad public policy , it is unnecessary , as most of these laws have security exemptions already written into them . however , in addition to environmental laws , this provision would waive labor laws , safety standards , the national historic preservation act , and the native ",D
"mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding the time . mr. speaker , i am here to support the rule and encourage this body to move forward with legislation that we have already debated many times in the last congress and legislation that really solves a problem . i do suggest that using terms like `` immigrant hater '' does not help this debate . this is about border security . it is not about those of us who reach out to help immigrants , particularly those immigrants who are here legally and lawfully all the time . it is not even about whether they are disadvantaged by people who are here illegally . this is about three significant border security issues . one is id and clearly id issued by states is important and significant . the bipartisan commission that looked into 9/11 dealt specifically with this issue , something that has been overlooked in much of our debate now , the almost-sanctified 9/11 commission . that commission said travel documents are as important as weapons and urged the congress to do something about travel documents that did not reflect the true status of individuals . in fact , on september 11 , driver 's licenses became weapons of mass destruction . in the united states today , a driver 's license is all it takes to transfer money to a bank account , to enter a federal building or other vulnerable facility , to board a train or an airplane . lax standards and loopholes in the current issuance processes allow terrorists to obtain driver 's licenses , often multiple licenses from different states . in southwest missouri , where i am from and right in the middle of the country , of the 1 , 387 people who were detained by the office there who were illegally in the country in the year that ended september 30 , 50 percent of those people had a state-issued driver 's license or state-issued id card , not at all difficult to get . of the 19 terrorists on 9/11 , they had five dozen driver 's licenses between them and used those driver 's licenses to get on the planes that crashed into the world trade center , the pentagon , and a field in pennsylvania . this act would require identity documents to expire at the same time a visa expires , so that someone who is here on an appropriate 6-month visa , as , in fact , much to our amazement , some of the 9/11 terrorists were , are not given a 6-years ' driver 's license when the documents they do produce say they can legally be here for 6 months . this bill also tightens the process of applying for asylum in the united states to close loopholes in the system that have been taken advantage of by terrorists . this issue was widely debated on the floor last year . the example i gave was the terrorist who was here from jordan who had bombed an international school in jordan full of american kids . well , that terrorist had not committed a crime in this country and under the current law was allowed to stay here unsupervised in a country full of american kids . certainly that is not acceptable . that person should have had to have a hearing . this legislation requires that . i urge that we adopt the rule and the legislation .

"mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i rise , of course , in support of this supplemental . i also want to rise to really express my appreciation to the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis ) and the tremendous job he has done in limiting the scope of this supplemental and getting this work done in a quick way , and moving forward on the rest of our appropriations process at the same time . these measures can often become reasons not to move forward with the normal work of the house , and the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis ) and his committee and their staff have really accepted double responsibility and double duty by doing these things at the same time . this bill does include , as my friend from maryland ( mr. hoyer ) xz4001890 mentioned , the embassy compound in baghdad . he and i visited the current embassy together in december , and i think we disagree on the need to go ahead and get this project started now . the project is 10 percent below the amount of money that the administration asked for . it is a substantial amount of money . it is a difficult environment , but bidding and starting these projects simply can not happen if we have a little piece of that money to start with ; you have to have the money available so that this embassy can be built and that our people representing us there in the embassy can be secure . we had two people killed in the current embassy compound in recent weeks from a missile that was fired there , and we need to move forward . in addition to providing vital funding for our troops in fighting the war , this bill also addresses some of the border vulnerabilities identified by the 9/11 commission . this legislation does not create a national id card or a national database , but it does move forward in securing our borders and making our asylum process work better to protect americans , both young and old . this legislation tightens the asylum system because of that . finally , this legislation provides $ 635 million for increased border security and enforcement . that includes $ 176 million to hire , train , equip , and support 500 border patrol agents and relieve current facility overcrowding . it includes almost half a billion dollars for immigration and customs enforcement , which includes $ 97.5 million to hire and train additional criminal investigators and immigration enforcement agents . this bill works to protect our fighting forces abroad , to help secure our borders at home , to move us forward in the war against terror . i appreciate the committee 's work on it , and i encourage its approval today . ",R
"mr. chairman , today i rise to express my concern over a provision in h.r. 418 , the real id act of 2005 . section 102 of this act states that the secretary of homeland security shall have the authority to waive , and shall waive , all laws necessary to ensure expeditious construction of barriers and roads in the vicinity of the u.s. border in areas of high illegal entry . the provision also bars judicial review of any claim arising from the construction of barriers and roads at borders . i understand that this provision is intended to apply primarily to the fence along the border near san diego . the construction of that fence is critical to our national security and has been delayed for far too long and i think it is imperative that it be constructed as soon as possible . however , i believe the provision currently contained in this bill is far too sweeping . it should not be necessary to waive all laws and judicial review relating to the construction of roads and barriers along the border in order to complete the fence near san diego . i hope that as the bill moves forward we can find a solution that will lead to the swift construction of this fence without sweeping away important laws . ",R
"mr. chairman , i would like to thank chairman sensenbrenner for his tireless efforts and leadership in getting the real id act to the floor and for championing national security issues and the crisis we face today with our nation 's border security . i would also like to thank my colleagues in the southern california delegation for their efforts and for helping to protect not only their districts , but also the nation 's borders as well . san diego border fence : for too long our nation has been playing chicken with our national security by ignoring the need to take a comprehensive approach to border security issues , particularly as they pertain to the mexican border . the mexican border has long been a porous and unguarded route for anyone wishing to sneak into the united states to inflict harm on our nation and our citizens , including terrorists . in particular , the san diego sector covers an area of more than 7 , 000 square miles and 66 miles of international border with mexico . beyond that section of the border are the mexican cities of tijuana and tecate , which boasts a combined population of more than 2 million people . this area of the border has been a heavily traveled route for illegal immigrants and potential terrorists due to the major cities and transportation hubs , such as lax airport in los angeles . this area alone accounts for nearly 50 percent of national apprehensions of illegal immigrants nationwide . a significant number of illegal immigrants that have been apprehended in this area can be directly attributed to the san diego fence that was constructed a few years ago . the san diego fence is a project that was started several years ago , but a 3.5-mile section of the fence was not completed due to environmental concerns . the portions of the san diego fence that have been built have proven to be successful and are credited with significant declines in attempted border crossings in that area . the existing fence needs improvements and must be extended 3.5 miles to its originally planned length . this legislation puts those priorities front and center by granting the secretary of homeland security the authority to waive all federal laws in order to complete the fence . in addition , this bill will increase the funding to improve the existing fence with a 3-tiered fence system and complete the original designed length . while environmental issues plays an appropriate role in our nations ' policies , the environmental and national security impacts of having illegal immigrants trample this portion of the border is greater than the concerns regarding building and completing the fence . lastly , recent press accounts have reported that al qaeda operatives have joined forces with alien smuggling rings in order to enter the united states , particularly through the southern border with mexico . the time to act on the san diego border fence is now . drivers ' license : real id act also bolsters stronger security standards for the issuance of drivers ' licenses to aliens . this bill will establish requirements that help prove lawful presence in the united states prior to issuing a license to individuals . in addition , it is critical that all states must comply to eliminate weak links in the domestic identity security . we have all seen the failures of cards such as the matriculate consular cards and the widespread fraud that can take place . this bill requires tough physical security requirements to reduce counterfeiting and to ensure state compliance with such standards . lastly , drivers ' licenses that are issued in compliance with the new regulations will expire when an alien 's visa expires to alleviate any confusion or ability for terrorists asylum provisions : finally , the real id act will tighten the asylum system that has been abused and gamed by terrorists for years . this bill allows judges to determine a witnesses ' credibility in their asylum cases . without this change , judges have no discretion in determining the credibility of witnesses testifying that they are being persecuted . judge 's hands have been tied over the years and must just grant asylum in every case where persecution has been raised and have not been able to go beyond that point . this has allowed terrorists who have been persecuted in their home country for being terrorists to seek shelter in the united states . currently , this argument can not be used against them and is not grounds for deportation . this bill gives the power to refuse terrorists entry to the united states and allows terrorists to be deported back to their home country . terrorists have long been abusing our system in order to gain entry . this bill provides a list of long-accepted commonsense factors that an immigration judge can consider in assessing credibility , such as the demeanor , candor , responsiveness and consistency of an asylum applicant or other witness . it is essential for judges to be able to determine asylum cases based on the credibility or lack of credibility of witnesses . again , i would to thank chairman sensenbrenner for his efforts in getting this bill to the floor and i strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill because these reforms are necessary to our national security . ",R
"mr. chairman , i rise today in very strong support of the bill , h.r. 418 , and also the very fine amendment of the gentleman from texas ( mr. sessions ) xz4003670 . i spoke on the floor last december in opposition to the conference report on the intelligence bill because it lacked the provisions that we are actually debating here today . i commend the leadership of , certainly , the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) and the gentleman from texas ( mr. sessions ) xz4003670 , for bringing this amendment to our attention and adding it to the bill . i am very pleased that they made good on their promise that we would be here today providing for the provisions that the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 had . no issue is more important to this congress than securing our borders and protecting our homeland , and i guarantee it is very important to our constituents . when i was in the florida senate , i headed up the homeland security committee shortly after 9/11 , and many of the provisions that are in this bill we actually included when we took on the driver 's license issue , making the driver 's licenses only last as long as the person was legally in the country . i applaud the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) and the house leadership for making good on their promise and enacting the recommendations made by the 9/11 commission . i urge my colleagues to vote for the bill and certainly for the amendment of the gentleman from texas ( mr. sessions ) xz4003670 , which just quite honestly makes common sense in that members ' constituents back home will very easily understand and say , why was this not done a long time ago ? ",R
"mr. chairman , i move to strike the last word . ",R
"mr. chairman , i have some concerns about provisions in section 1113 of the bill relating to service members group life insurance , which i will now referral to as sgli . neither the department of veterans affairs nor the house committee on veterans ' affairs , the authorizing committee with jurisdiction over va insurance programs , was consulted prior to the administration 's submitting the insurance proposals in the war supplemental . i recognize that it placed the gentleman from california ( mr. lewis ) xz4002391 and the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 in very difficult positions , because they always come to the floor to talk about authorizing on appropriations bills ; but that is what you are doing exactly here . there are two primary points of concern with regard to these sections . number one , it would authorize retroactive insurance coverage in cases of servicemembers who die having declined insurance coverage ; and , second , it would require a spouse to concur with the servicemember 's insurance coverage election . the administration proposed to provide for a retroactive payment to give the same level of benefits proposed for prospective maximum sgli to those who have died since the beginning of combat operations on october 7 , 2001 . at the appropriations markup , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 offered an amendment , which was accepted , to limit retroactive payment to those who died in performance of duty . by restricting payments to deaths that the service secretary concerned determines in the performance of duty , we would then expect that deaths which occurred during the performance of an assigned military duty would be compensated , but that deaths not associated with assigned military duties would not qualify . another qualifier , though , that perhaps should have been considered during this markup , would have been in addition to dying in performance of military duties , the servicemember must have had maximum insurance coverage at the time of death . the committee on veterans ' affairs has established a record in this regard . when we increased the sgli coverage from $ 200 , 000 to $ 250 , 000 with a delayed effective date in public law 106-419 , then in reaction to the terrorist attack on the uss cole we did , in fact , make a retroactivity in public law 107-14 for servicemembers who died in performance of duty that had maximum sgli at the time of their death . we should not be providing the maximum amount of insurance posthumously if the servicemember declined coverage , hence , never paid premiums , or elected a lesser amount . this is a policy change that could have detrimental effects . the bottom line is that it changes the identity and substance of the sgli program . sgli is neither an indemnity nor a gratuity program . it is an insurance program . second , i have great concern regarding the administration 's proposal to include in h.r. 1268 that a spouse must concur with a servicemember 's insurance election . life insurance is a contract . requiring a spouse who is not a party to the contract to assent to a servicemember 's decision concerning whether to enter into a contract and the amount of that contract violates the principles of contractual law and the nature of life insurance . requiring the spouse to concur with the servicemember 's decision , as included in h.r. 1268 , would in fact make sgli a volunteer program for single servicemembers , and an involuntary program for married servicemembers . life insurance policies are fundamentally different from the protection to surviving spouses rightfully provided under some other retirement programs . there are plenty of substantive concerns with regard to this provision : one , giving the spouse veto power over the amount of insurance that gives him or her greater say than the servicemember . number two , sgli would in fact be a voluntary program for singles , involuntary for married . three , the concurrence policy would force the servicemember to pay premiums and keep the spouse as a beneficiary , even in situations of pending divorce , spousal abuse , drug abuse , child abuse . i mean , let your mind go . fourth , the spousal concurrence as drafted in the bill would prevent a servicemember from naming children , children from a previous marriage , parents , grandparents , guardians of grandchildren , let your mind go , from participating in insurance . the supreme court has upheld the right of the insured to name whoever he or she wants as a beneficiary , even if it is in violation of a state court divorce decree . there are administrative concerns as well , the substantial administrative costs that would be added in the day-to-day running of this program , as well as has been added to its greater complexity . if a servicemember there says that there is no spouse or names another beneficiary and declines coverage , a spouse could come forward after the servicemember 's death . another concern is the program may be liable to pay maximum amounts if no premiums were collected or if a separate beneficiary already had been paid . and if there is a delay in getting a spouse to agree to insurance coverage or the amount and the servicemember dies , then who receives the benefits ? these are many , many issues that need to be resolved , and i look forward to working with the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis ) as we proceed forward to the conference to address many of these issues . mr. chairman , i include the following letter from the military officers association of america for the record . of america , alexandria , va , march 11 , 2005 . dear mr . chairman : on behalf of the 370 , 000 members of the military officers association of america ( moaa ) , i am writing to inform you that , after discussing the issue extensively with the committee 's majority and minority staff , moaa has reconsidered its position on the servicemen 's group life insurance ( sgli ) spousal consent requirement , as included in the appropriations committee 's markup of the fy2005 defense supplemental appropriations act . we believe there is merit to the staff 's view that the appropriations committee 's language is excessively stringent and could inappropriately preclude servicemembers ' ability to make reasonable insurance decisions -- especially in circumstances where it may be reasonable and appropriate for a member to designate children as beneficiaries instead of the current spouse . moaa believes congress is doing the right thing in expediting passage of improved death benefits coverage in the supplemental appropriations act , and we have no wish to slow that process in any way . therefore , moaa urges your support for a floor amendment that would either substitute a provision requiring spousal notification ( instead of spousal consent ) or strike the spousal consent requirement to allow the committee to develop more appropriate language that could be offered in conference or another appropriate legislative venue . sincerely , colonel , usaf ( ret ) , ",R
i had a very good discussion with the gentleman from california ( mr. lewis ) xz4002391 . i did not come here to the floor to strike these provisions from the bill . i will work with the administration . i will work with the committee on appropriations . i am going to do that as an authorizer . i am not claiming jurisdictional grounds . i am not going to play games with the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 at all . ,R
"i thought what the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 did by making a performance of duty was a wise thing . i think that was a wise move of the gentleman . i do not know why the gentleman would be upset with regard to my remarks on performance of duty because what the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 did is followed what we , the gentleman from illinois ( mr. evans ) xz4001260 and i , had also recommended . performance of duty is a good thing . ",R
i do not have a problem with the performance of duty . i have come to the floor to express some concerns with regard to the identification of an insurance product . we are turning it into an indemnity and a gratuity with regard to an insurance product . we have to be smart about our business with regard to how we proceed . that is my purpose of being here . it is not to reach into the treasury and just say we are going to give this money out . ,R
but it does and i gave the example because you can have someone who has an accidental death or a duty nonperformance in the service . ,R
"no , the gentleman 's amendment . ",R
i will be more than happy to get the gentleman legal counsel so he can understand what he has written . ,R
i thank the gentleman . what the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 did with regard to performance -- -- ,R
"i believe that the performance of duty that is in the bill , what it does , it does identify with regard to who will receive payment and who do not receive payments . that was why i used the word `` limited '' or `` restricted '' because you could have an individual , mr. chairman , of whom died in an auto accident , was murdered , or something happened to them and they do not qualify . ",R
"absolutely . that is why what we have here are two individuals of whom understand what we are talking about but probably have a , well , anyway , let us not use semantics . what i do wish to do as we proceed forward as we go to conference working with the senate is work also with the administration , work with the department of defense , the va and omb to make sure that we bring a proper identity with regard to service and group life insurance that also subsidizes veterans group life insurance , and that is what i want to work with the chairman on . ",R
"mr. speaker , i rise today in support of the rule on h.r. 418 . our nation 's immigration policy has been of top concern in recent years , and for good reason . with between eight and twelve million illegal aliens in the united states , it is obviously a problem out of control . we need to increase border security and fix our immigration laws . we need a system that will encourage well-intentioned , contributing aliens out of the shadows and allow them to pay a reasonable penalty so they can come into compliance with the law . americans are rightly concerned about the security and the integrity of the nation 's borders because the system is broken . some are concerned about the possibility of terrorists crossing our borders and coming into our cities . but we can not effectively fight terrorism if we fail to make the distinction between them and busboys and housekeepers . from 1990 to 2000 , the number of u.s. border patrol agents nearly tripled , but illegal immigration increased by as much as 5.5 million . increasing enforcement resources to keep out willing immigrant workers , as we did throughout the 1990s , has not worked . it has failed , and we need enforcement to be much more narrowly focused on criminals and potential terrorists . today , we are considering h.r. 418 . this legislation begins the debate on the enforcement aspects of immigration and addresses the narrow issue of driver license security . i have reservations about the gradual move toward what could become a national id card , but this legislation begins to address issues necessary to focus efforts in enforcement . mr. speaker , i intend to vote in favor of h.r. 418 , but while doing so , i suggest that enforcement , border security and immigration reform must be worked on together . in fact , fixing the broken system requires a broader strategy that includes both enforcement and the creation of adequate legal channels for immigration that serve the nation 's interests . by creating legal channels for those looking for a better life and looking to fill jobs that americans will not fill , we enhance our enforcement efforts . the responsible authorities can focus their resources first on the worst actors . our immigration laws and policies must reflect the realities we face today . our economy demands workers , but our national security demands that we identify those lurking in the shadows . enhanced enforcement must be the top priority for immigration policy . the american people are not anti-immigrant . we are concerned about the lack of coherence in our immigration policy and enforcement . as part of today 's debate , we must realize that the congress needs to address the other issues with immigration reform now . broader immigration reform has been outlined by president bush . i commend him for his act of leadership . he has outlined the solution and now congress must act quickly in crafting legislation . this bill is our first step in a long journey to restore public confidence in an open , welcoming immigration code . let us give thanks to our immigrants when b.c . forbes sailed for america from scotland in 1904 , he was following a course well worn by generations of scots . i know how the founder of forbes magazine must have felt . the murdochs originally hail from the same part of scotland . today , we are part of the most recent wave of immigrants attracted by the bright beacon of american liberty . these days , it 's not always easy to talk about the benefits of immigration . especially since 9/11 , many americans worry about borders and security . these are legitimate concerns . but surely a nation as great as america has the wit and resources to distinguish between those who come here to destroy the american dream -- and the many millions more who come to live it . the evidence of the contributions these immigrants make to our society is all around us -- especially in the critical area of education . adam smith , another scotsman , knew that without a decent system of education , a modem capitalist society was committing suicide . well , our modern public school systems simply are not producing the talent the american economy needs to compete in the future . and it often seems that it is our immigrants who are holding the whole thing up . in a study on high school students released this past summer , the national foundation for american policy found 60 percent of the top science students , and 65 percent of the top math students , are children of immigrants . the same study found that seven of the top award winners at the 2004 intel science talent search were immigrants or children of immigrants . this correlates with other findings that more than half of engineers -- and 45 percent of math and computer scientists -- with ph.d.s now working in the u.s. are foreign born . it 's not just the statistics . you see it at our most elite college and university campuses , where asian immigrants or their children are disproportionately represented . and a recent study of 28 prestigious american universities by researchers from princeton and the university of pennsylvania found something startling : that 41 percent of the black students attending these schools described themselves as either immigrants or children of immigrants . the point is that by almost any measure of educational excellence you choose , if you 're in america you 're going to find immigrants or their children at the top . i do n't just mean engineers and scientists and technicians . in my book , anyone who comes here and gives an honest day 's work for an honest day 's pay is not only putting himself closer to the american dream , he 's helping the rest of us get there too . as ronald reagan said at the statue of liberty , `` while we applaud those immigrants who stand out , whose contributions are easily discerned , we know that america 's heroes are also those whose names are remembered by only a few. '' let me share some of these names with you . start with eddie chin , an ethnic chinese marine who was born a week after his family fled burma . you 've all seen cpl . chin . because when baghdad fell , he was the marine we all watched shimmy up the statue of saddam hussein to attach the cable that would pull it down . or lance cpl . ahmad ibrahim . his family came to the u.s. from syria when the first gulf war broke out . now cpl . ibrahim hopes to be deployed to iraq -- also as a marine -- to put his arabic language skills in the service of corps and country . or what about cpl . jos gutierrez , who was raised in guatemala and came to america as a boy -- illegally ! cpl . gutierrez was one of the first marines killed in action in iraq . as his family told reporters , this young immigrant enlisted with the marine corps because he wanted to `` give back '' to america . so here we have it -- asian marines , arab marines , latino marines -- all united in the mission of protecting the rest of us . is n't this what reagan meant when he said that the bond that ties our immigrants together -- what makes us a nation instead of a collection of individuals -- is `` an abiding love of liberty '' ? so the next time you hear people whining about what a `` drain '' on america our immigrants are , it might be worth asking if they consider these marines a drain . maybe this is more clear to businessmen because of what we see every day . my company , news corporation , is a multinational company based in america . our diversity is based on talent , cooperation and ability . frankly it does n't bother me in the least that millions of people are attracted to our shores . what we should worry about is the day they no longer find these shores attractive . in an era when too many of our pundits declare that the american dream is a fraud , it is america 's immigrants who remind us -- by dint of their success -- that the dream is alive , and well within reach of anyone willing to work for it . we are fortunate to have a president who understands that . only a few days ago , the white house indicated that it intended to revive an immigration reform which the president had first offered before 9/11 and tried to revive back in january . politically speaking , a guest-worker plan is no easy thing . but as president bush realizes , we 'll never fix the problem of illegal immigration simply by throwing up walls and trying to make all of us police them . we 've tried that for a decade or so now , and it 's been a flop . what we need to do first is to make it easier for those who seek honest work to do so without having to disobey our laws . fundamentally that means recognizing that an economy as powerful as ours is always going to have a demand for more workers . such a policy would benefit us all : it would help those who want nothing more than to work legally move out of the shadows . it would help our security forces stop wasting resources now spent on hunting down mexican waitresses and start devoting them to tracking the terrorists who really threaten us . it would help the economy by providing america with the labor and talent it needs . given the tremendous pressures on president bush and the considerable opposition from within his own ranks , the politically expedient thing for him to do would be to drop it . but he has n't , and i for one am encouraged by his refusal to give in . the immigrant editor b.c . forbes spent much of the 20th century championing the glories of american opportunity . we who have arrived more recently likewise will never forget our debt we owe to this land -- and the obligation to keep that same opportunity alive in the 21st . mr. murdoch is chairman and chief executive of news corporation . this is adapted from a speech he gave last thursday , in acceptance of the 2004 b.c . forbes award . immigration reform : a 3-legged stool while not a major theme of last fall 's campaign , a debate on immigration reform will be front and center in the early days of the new bush administration . early last year , president bush acknowledged that our immigration system is broken and needs to be fixed . for this he deserves credit . recognizing that there is a problem is a critical first step toward finding a solution . in the past 10 years , more than $ 20 billion has been spent on adding border patrol agents , building fencing and employing technology to prevent border crossings . during roughly the same period , however , estimates on the net number of undocumented entering the country have risen from about 300 , 000 per year to about 500 , 000 per year . more disturbing is that , in the past five years , more than 2 , 000 migrants have lost their lives perishing in remote portions of the american southwest . and yet those who survive the gauntlet of a dangerous border crossing find work in short order . our economy needs their manpower : the labor department projects that , by the year 2008 , there will be 6 million more low-skilled jobs available than americans able to fill them . at the same time , these workers contribute billions to the tax and social security systems . truth be told , our current system , instead of discouraging undocumented migration , makes it inevitable because adequate provisions in law do not exist to match up willing workers from other countries with unfilled jobs here . work visas for unskilled workers are absurdly small compared to the demand -- 5 , 000 in the permanent system and up to 66 , 000 in the temporary one . family-unity visas can be even scarcer , with waiting times as long as 10 years for mexican families to be reunited with a relative who is a u.s. citizen or legal resident . we need immigration reform legislation with three major components , akin to a three-legged stool . the administration plan proposed last january addresses only one leg -- employment -- which is insufficient to support the weight on the system . first , any new proposal should feature means for undocumented long-term residents to access permanent residency . legalization does not necessarily mean amnesty . it can be conditioned on any number of criteria including -- for example , `` sweat equity '' the undocumented have already accrued through their work in the united states . such a legal remedy would stabilize both immigrant families and the labor force . second , it should reform the employment-based legal immigration system in a way that increases legal avenues to work while protecting the rights of both foreign-born and u.s. workers . this would permit future flows of workers to enter safely and legally and reduce deaths at the border . third , the plan should shorten waiting times under the family reunification system . too often , our current system separates husbands from wives and parents from children , a morally unacceptable outcome in a nation built upon the strength of the family . anti-immigrant polemicists ignore the human tragedy and familial dislocation enabled by the status quo , while discounting the invaluable contributions immigrants make to our nation . americans are , as a whole , fair-minded people . we can not continue to accept the benefits of undocumented laborers but be unwilling to extend to them the protection of the law . the undocumented are not `` breaking '' the law as much as they are being `` broken '' by the law . after our country 's unhappy experience with jim crow `` laws '' that resulted in the creation of a large black underc1ass , we should not repeat the same mistake in tolerating the creation of a large immigrant underc1ass by not affording legal remedies that would afford them the protection of law and the opportunity for upward mobility . we applaud the president for recognizing how the present immigration regime hurts both americans and undocumented immigrants in america . the new congress should work with president bush to enact a comprehensive solution to our immigration crisis . only such a `` three-legged '' comprehensive approach will protect human rights and prepare our nation for the challenges of the future . for doable policy resolving the dilemma posed by many millions of `` undocumented '' workers in america requires compromise that few will find completely satisfying . temporary work permits will please neither those who want all illegal immigrants deported nor those who want another round of amnesty . amnesty is politically untenable , and deporting millions of people is not doable . it would require enormous amounts of money and manpower from a government that is already strapped to meet current social obligations and international commitments . president bush told reporters recently that he wants u.s. border patrol agents chasing `` crooks and thieves and drug-runners and terrorists , not good-hearted people who are coming here to work. '' the president is seeking levelheaded immigration legislation that could improve domestic security and put policy in line with the needs of the globalized american economy . the most sensible approach would offer legitimacy to those who have worked diligently in america , while imposing and enforcing tough employer sanctions against companies that continue to employ undocumented workers . this would weaken the so-called magnet effect that lures otherwise law-abiding people to jump the border . such a policy requires several key provisions . one would obligate illegal immigrants to come out of the shadows to prove their identities in return for some form of legitimate status . this type of trade-off serves u.s. interests by identifying those who are here `` to work , '' as the president has said . bringing them out of the woodwork would allow law enforcement agents to focus more sharply on catching those who are here to do harm . a reform bill should take into account the brainpower needs of the u.s. economy . there are untold numbers of people around the world who are standing in line to legally enter the united states , and many of these would-be immigrants possess skills that american employers need . since the sept . 11 attacks , this process has become cumbersome and counterproductive . immigration reform should streamline the process for granting skilled foreigners access to the united states , particularly those well-suited for workplaces that have a tough time finding qualified hands . there 's no reason the united states ca n't have a policy that promotes safety while meeting the needs of the workplace . congress and the white house can find suitable resolutions to the security , social and labor quandaries posed by immigration if prejudices and stigmas are shoved aside in favor of rational proposals that bolster u.s. security and global competitiveness . ",R
"mr. chairman , i would like to submit a statement for the record from the americans for tax reform . february 9 , 2005 . our nation 's immigration and border control policies cry out for reform . while our best border control officers should be preventing the next terrorist incursion into our country , they are instead hunting down willing workers . the attacks of september 11th called for new and updated thinking in all areas of federal law enforcement , and immigration reform has been a glaring omission . america 's immigration system must be reformed in a responsible , welcoming , adult manner along the lines laid out by president bush . willing workers should be matched with willing employers , citizenship and residency applications must be streamlined , and the focus must shift to protecting the nation from terrorists . border security has been increased since 9/11 , and should continue to be so . the latest technology must be used to make sure america 's border is free of terrorist incursions . in order to let the border guard do their job of defending america , the president supports giving foreign laborers guest worker cards , `` to match willing workers with willing employers. '' president bush is opposed to amnesty for illegal immigrants . he also does not want to give foreigners in the guest worker program any advantage over those who are trying to become citizens through normal , due process channels . congress should support president bush 's common-sense plan to reform and strengthen america 's broken immigration system even as border security is addressed today in the house of representatives . grover norquist , ",R
"mr. chairman , i congratulate the chairman and the committee on government reform for reporting out this bill that is so important that this congress take action on and take action on now . of course we need to do this . of course we need to pass the real id act . because as the chairman just said , certainly all of us who board planes want to know that there is some integrity to our id system in this country and that terrorists are not boarding planes by the use of a state-issued identification card . this is not conjecture . this is what happened on 9/11 . this is what the 9/11 commission suggested that we take action on , and this is what we are here doing today . as the chairman suggested , i am proud to say that in 2003 virginia , under the leadership of former attorney general jerry kilgore , acted to close this dangerous loophole . the general assembly passed and the governor signed into law a provision which requires the minimum standard , which says that anyone applying for a license in virginia must have legal status in this country ; that they must have a visa ; and that the license that would be issued would coterminate with the termination or expiration of that visa . this is just common sense . why do we want terrorists to have a license issued by a state to go and board our airplanes and commandeer those airplanes into a building ? it is time for congress to act , to provide and mandate a minimum standard for states when they issue state ids , including driver 's licenses , to require that individuals who have that privilege be here in this country legally . mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from virginia ( mr. tom davis ) for his leadership on this , and i urge passage of the real id act . ",R
"mr. speaker , i rise today to voice my strong support for h.r. 1268 , the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense , the global war on terror , and tsunami relief . this essential legislation will support and defend america 's values both at home and abroad . our troops serving in iraq will have the necessary tools to continue their rebuilding efforts in iraq and to continue the war on terror . at home , the real id provisions will strengthen our nation 's driver 's license laws , providing each citizen with another layer of security . until now , terrorists could easily exploit weak driver licensing laws and obtain fake documents . with a license in hand , terrorists were better able to blend in , avoid detection , and harm our nation 's citizens . this is exactly what several of the 9/11 terrorists did , using drivers ' licenses to board airplanes and murder thousands of innocent americans on september 11 , 2001 . we in congress have been working on ways to prevent our nation from experiencing another terrorist attack by establishing stronger and more secure national programs . stronger driver 's license standards made possible by the real id provisions will be another step towards american security . the real id provisions will close dangerous gaps that remain in our current licensing law and that allow terrorists to abuse our asylum and driver 's license systems . the new law will protect innocent americans by setting up national driver 's license standards , networking state motor vehicle data bases , and linking visa and license expirations . in 2003 , the former attorney general of virginia , jerry kilgore , and i worked together on the driver 's license integrity act . that legislation required non-immigrant aliens to show their visas when applying for state identification and tied the expiration date of the identification to that of the visa . due to mr. kilgore 's leadership on this issue , the commonwealth of virginia was one of the first states to clamp down on terrorists ' abuse of the trust that a driver 's license conveys . today , i am pleased to see virginia 's driver 's license integrity act provisions in this piece of legislation before us in the house of representatives . since the beginning of the war on terror , congress has fought daily to ensure that our nation never again suffers at the hands of terrorists . the provisions in this bill provide us with more weapons in our arsenal against terrorism . i urge passage of this legislation . ",R
"mr. chairman , i move to strike the last word . ",D
"mr. chairman , i wish to discuss one critically important component of this bill , the $ 200 million in aid to the palestinians . the president has requested $ 350 million for the palestinians , and he asks that $ 200 million be included in today 's supplemental bill . the president believes , as do i , that it is imperative to deliver u.s. assistance quickly to improve palestinians ' quality of life and empower their democratically elected leadership . i am pleased this bill funds the palestinian assistance request . this money will be used on critical projects , such transportation infrastructure , drinking water , business and trade , education and democratic and legal reforms . mr. chairman , on january 9 , i was privileged to witness the remarkable palestinian presidential election firsthand . i saw democracy taking hold in palestine . i saw the mandate being handed to president abbas . the palestinian people support their new president 's goals , to end the armed intifadah and to create a viable state living in peace alongside israel . mr. chairman , the arafat era is over . the new palestinian president and his government are making great strides . they are committed to political reform . their financial reform efforts , which are led by minister salaam fayyad , have produced profound accountability and transparency . on the critical question of security , president abbas is also off to a good start . he has clearly and unequivocally condemned terrorism . with the exception of one horrific bombing in tel aviv , the cease-fire has held . the palestinian security forces have begun to fight terror and incitement . they have arrested terrorists for the first time in many years . yesterday , here on capitol hill , the ambassador of israel sat next to the palestinian ambassador and praised the palestinian authority for their security efforts . prime minister sharon has welcomed the palestinian moves as well . mr. chairman , the real question before us today is not whether to keep the $ 200 million for palestinian assistance in this bill . clearly , this package serves u.s. national interests and will enhance israel 's security and the quality of life for the palestinians . but the real question is whether the u.s. congress is serious about working with president bush , prime minister sharon , and president abbas to seize this historic opportunity . the excessive conditions and limitations placed on this package may undermine progress toward peace . of course , we must secure transparency and accountability ; but the requirements in this legislation go far beyond what we demanded in the arafat era . imagine that . president bush and prime minister sharon are helping to strengthen and empower president abbas , but at the same time congress will slap more conditions on them than they ever did on arafat . one especially troubling provision in the bill strikes the national security waiver under which the president could provide some of this aid directly to the palestinian authority . president bush has decided in the past that some u.s. aid be directed to the authority . this bill would prevent him from doing that , tying his hands at the very moment that he most needs flexibility to promote our interests in the middle east . my colleagues should understand this bill puts more restrictions on the president than we ever placed on president clinton . mr. chairman , there is a broad consensus in the american pro-israel community in support of the president 's aid request for the palestinians . the jewish council for public affairs , the umbrella group of 13 prominent national organizations and 122 local jewish communities , has recently urged congress to fund the palestinian request in its entirety . the union for reform judaism , representing 1.5 million american jews , believes the aid should go directly to the palestinian authority . americans for peace now wants us to support this package and remove the excessive conditions that the committee has placed on it . in asking us to support a clean aid package , m.j. rosenberg of the israel policy forum states the following : `` israel wants a strong palestinian authority that can and will liquidate the suicide bombers and build a democracy that will live in peace with israel. '' the arafat years are over . fragile as it may be , a new flame of hope and optimism has been kindled in the middle east . shame on us as americans if we do not do whatever we can to seize this historic opportunity . mr. chairman , i urge my colleagues to support the $ 200 million in palestinian assistance , i urge us to reject any amendments to strip this aid , and i hope in the conference with the senate that we can give back to the president the flexibility he needs to promote u.s. security interests in the region . ",D
"mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 1268 , to authorize emergency supplemental appropriations for our military . the vast majority of this $ 82 billion bill will go directly to support our troops in iraq and afghanistan . congress has a responsibility to work with the president to protect the national security of our nation . when our soldiers are sent in to war , it is the congress ' responsibility to make sure that all resources necessary are provided to carry out their missions . i stand behind our brave men and women who have performed admirably in iraq and afghanistan . they have made tremendous sacrifices on behalf of their country and have served longer deployments than expected . this bill provides important new benefits for our troops and their families . the legislation : increases the military death gratuity ; increases subsidized life insurance benefits ; creates a new insurance benefit for soldiers who have suffered traumatic injuries , such as the loss of a limb ; extends the basic allowance for housing for dependents of soldiers who die while on active duty ; and provides additional funding for add-on vehicle armor kits , night-vision equipment , and radio jammers that disrupt remote-control bombs and mines . the conference report also contains important measures to strengthen our domestic border security , by providing funds for new border patrol agents , immigration and customs investigators , enforcement agents , and detention officers . the bill also provides additional foreign assistance for : tsunami reconstruction ; humanitarian and peacekeeping programs in darfur ; democracy assistance in belarus ; and political and economic reforms in ukraine to strengthen their new democracy and legal system . i regret that the administration has consistently failed to properly budget for our ongoing military and reconstruction operations in iraq . congress should not repeatedly rely on emergency spending bills to provide the critical funding , resources , and equipment for our troops in battle by using emergency supplemental appropriations bills . the united states is only belatedly seeking international support for our reconstruction efforts in iraq , and we have failed to broadly engage the international community . because of these failures , americans have paid a heavy price . it is primarily american troops stationed in iraq that face continuing attacks , and have lost life and limb . it is our taxpayers that are being asked to almost exclusively pay the cost to rebuild iraq , and these costs are mounting every day . iraq is already facing a difficult transition in establishing a democracy that operates under the rule of law and protects minority rights . the u.s. must show enough flexibility in working with our allies to effectively help iraq during this critical transition period , so that other countries will pledge both troops and funds to alleviate the burden on our american soldiers and taxpayers . ultimately , the best way that we can support our troops is to reach out more aggressively to the international community , establish order and security in iraq , and help the interim iraqi government assume more responsibility for its own affairs as they establish a democratic state . i am also disappointed that the republican leadership decided to insert extraneous provisions into this legislation , which go beyond the scope of the 9/11 commission recommendations . i voted against the `` real id act '' when it was considered by this house as a separate bill earlier this year . i am particularly concerned that this legislation repeals a number of provisions of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 , which enacted the recommendations of the 9/11 commission . the 9/11 bill established a negotiated rulemaking framework -- allowing for critical input from governors , state legislators , state officials , and other stakeholders -- which would provide the opportunity to develop effective national standards for driver 's licenses . i am concerned that this legislation does not give the states adequate flexibility to implement the 9/11 bill , and that this legislation may also create serious unfunded mandates and administrative burdens for the states . as the ranking member of the helsinki commission ( commission on security and cooperation in europe ) , which promotes human rights and rule of law in europe , i am also concerned about many of the asylum law changes contained in the real id act , which again go beyond the scope of the 9/11 commission recommendations . these provisions may have a harmful effect on true asylum seekers , trafficking victims , women and children who are victims of domestic violence , and others seeking protection against persecution . this legislation may create higher burdens for legitimate asylum seekers , restrict judicial discretion to grant asylum , and take away some of the rights of appeal for certain refugees and asylum seekers . over the past week i have heard from a number of groups in maryland that provide legal and social services to immigrants , asylum seekers , refugees , and survivors of torture and slavery . these groups have reported to me that it is already extremely difficult for legitimate asylum seekers to prevail in their case , as they have often left their home country on short notice , and do not have documentation of their persecution . it can take months or years for a case to work its way through our legal system . during this period , the asylum seeker often has neither legal representation nor work documentation . i hope that in the near future congress will have the opportunity , in a more thoughtful manner , to consider comprehensive immigration reform measures . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . mr. chairman , i rise to offer a simple amendment to the very thorough legislation before us today . the gentleman from wisconsin 's ( chairman sensenbrenner ) dedication to fixing gaps in our security is commendable , and i am proud to join him in strengthening federal identity requirements , protecting those who need political asylum , and improving our border security . the 9/11 commission identified gates for boarding airplanes is the last opportunity for our screeners to use sources of identification to ensure that people are who they say they are , and frankly , obviously , to check whether they are terrorists . to improve this process , congress tasked the department of homeland security with the goal of developing and building upon the aviation watch lists that our screeners commonly rely upon today . my amendment is intended to enhance the information contained in homeland security 's aviation security screening databases and to ensure that our security is not compromised through the use of falsified driver 's licenses . specifically , the amendment would require homeland security to enter into the appropriate database any person convicted of using a false driver 's license in attempting to board an airplane . currently , aviation screeners at the transportation security administration immediately detain individuals suspected of presenting false driver 's licenses and then turn them over to the custody of either the department of justice or local authorities . the criminal justice system is then responsible for determining whether the suspect is guilty or innocent . under the present system , if convicted , this person is sentenced to federally mandated punishment , but the department of homeland security is not required to put their name on a watch list . my amendment would go a step further in protecting our nation by also requiring the department to enter a violator into one of its national aviation screening databases . improving the quantity and quality of information contained in these passenger-screening databases is essential to enhancing our ability to identify potential threats and prevent terrorists from gaining access to our airliners . when a person is convicted of trying to deceive security to get on an airplane , there is serious cause for alarm . my amendment would ensure that those convicted of using a false driver 's license in attempting to board an airplane would be red-flagged for airport screeners . the amendment does not impact persons who use false driver 's licenses for other purposes . it allows the criminal justice system to run its course , and it is focused solely on the last line of defense before terrorists board an airplane . it is a simple , cost-effective way to enhance the department of homeland security 's ability to track potential high-risk passengers . again , i appreciate the opportunity to offer a small but important step in improving our security databases . my amendment would ensure that those convicted of using a false driver 's license in attempting to board an airplane are red-flagged for airport screeners . the people screening passengers at the gates do their best to make sure terrorists are not getting on these planes . congress should do everything in our power to make their job easier . mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . ",R
"mr. chairman , i yield myself 1 minute , because i think the gentlewoman from texas has made some very valid points that need to be discussed . one thing that is important and what we have done here is to understand that there has to be a conviction in this situation by a court of law before it can be entered into a database of the transportation security administration . that is very important . it gives all the protection of what could happen there . we thought a lot about that because it was a matter of some concern . so a mere allegation or something that proves not to be true would never be entered into the database . i wanted to make that point . mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from connecticut ( mr. shays ) xz4003700 . ",R
"mr. chairman , will the gentlewoman yield ? ",R
"mr. chairman , i thank the gentlewoman for her good questions and for yielding . we are not sure at this point whether they include that information or not at tsa , because simply they have databases and we do not know necessarily what is in their databases , and i do not blame them at all . they are not prone to reveal all of that . it is our judgment they should be doing this . we hope that they would be doing it . we do not know if they are for sure or not . i can not confirm or deny that , because we simply do not know the answer to that particular question . i would imagine , and i am putting myself in their position and i am not an expert on this , but if you are there and are in the security forces there , you are obviously trained in document recognition to some great degree . some are better probably than others at this . obviously , if one has a database , it is obviously much more of a clear signal that this person needs to be looked at because they tried to do this before . that is the reason we feel it should be added into the database as it goes on . i do not think this is going to change actually the way they look at licenses presently in the first instance or even in second instance . it is just a trigger mark as other things might be in terms of potential risks . ",R
yes . ,R
"if the gentlewoman will yield further , it speaks very specifically to trial and conviction . ",R
"mr. chairman , if the gentlewoman would yield further , no , i would not have objected to having hearings . it is relatively simple . i do not mean to suggest it needs panels of hearings , but i never object to having a hearing . mr. chairman , i believe the gentlewoman from texas ( ms. jackson-lee ) xz4001990 has the right to close ? ",R
"mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the real id act , and i want to thank the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , for his efforts in this matter . it is very important . this bill is about common sense . it is about protecting our borders and making our country safer . the 9/11 commission report revealed many disconcerting facts , none more unnerving than the fact that all but one of the 9/11 hijackers who were here temporarily obtained valid driver 's licenses , enabling them to travel freely about the country . that is absurd , and the american people know it . this bill finally does something about that absurdity . we can not continue to let our laws be exploited and circumvented by future terrorists to further their plans of violence , destruction , and murder . with the real id act in place , we can better prevent future tragic events from occurring . mr. chairman , i urge my colleagues to pass this critical piece of legislation . ",R
"mr. speaker , i thank the gentlewoman from texas for yielding me this time . i would like to join in the point that is being made by the gentlewoman from texas to remind all of our friends that when republicans took power in 1994 , they made a solemn promise to the states that they would make sure that there would be no imposition of unfunded mandates on those states , and today we have a chance to redeem that promise by voting `` no '' on consideration of this rule , which waives the unfunded mandate requirement . the majority may , if they have not already , attempt to argue that it is a minor mandate and show new and improved cbo estimates showing that the cost of this bill is only $ 125 million over the next 5 years ; and , therefore , i think this warrants at minimum committee hearings in markups that has so far been denied this congress . so we are not asking a lot this afternoon . and i am impressed by the governors association . their letter points out that while they commend the gentleman from michigan ( chairman sensenbrenner ) and the gentleman from virginia ( mr. tom davis ) for their commitment to driver 's license integrity , they find that those bills would impose technological standards and verification procedures on states , many of which are beyond the current capacity of even the federal government . moreover , the cost of implementing such standards and verification procedures for the 220 million driver 's licenses issued by the states represents a massive unfunded mandate . so they close by urging us to allow the provisions of the intelligence reform act of 2004 to work . so i commend the gentlewoman from texas ( ms. jackson-lee ) xz4001990 for making such a very timely and important point of order , and i support her in it . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . mr. chairman , i rise , regrettably in opposition to this anti-immigrant legislation . mr. chairman , if we truly believe in all we have heard about the importance of freedom and liberty from our president and others , then we have no other choice but to vote down this bill which denies so much freedom and liberty to the immigrants in our own country . h.r. 418 includes provision after provision limiting the rights of refugees , imposing onerous new driver 's license requirements on the states , unfunded mandates , making it easier to deport legal immigrants , waiving all federal laws concerning construction of barriers and fences anywhere within the united states and denying immigrants long-standing habeas corpus rights . this is a work of art that has to be examined very , very carefully and very critically . if this measure becomes law , this will close america 's doors to cubans fleeing from their country , religious minorities attempting to escape religious persecution , women fleeing from sex trafficking , rape or forced abortions . unfortunately , in our history , there have been a number of examples of this overreaction in the past . for example , during the civil war , general ulysses grant , no less , sought to expel the jews from the south . the aftermath of world war i brought the notorious red scare , and the very long remembered anti-immigrant palmer raids from the attorney general of that era . of course , world war ii gave us the searing memory of the unconscionable internment of japanese americans . in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy , and even after the patriot act , which did its share of violating the rights of those who were in this country , this legislation would even further target immigrants for crimes they have not committed and for which they are not responsible . at some point we have to treat terrorism as a problem that requires intelligent response , as opposed to an excuse to scapegoat immigrants . for all these reasons , there are so many groups lined up behind the american civil liberties union to oppose the bill : immigration rights groups , civil rights groups , civil liberty organizations , private rights groups , labor organizations , environmental groups , native american rights , states ' rights and international human rights groups . so , i urge us in good conscience and serious concern over the direct and the subtle import of this legislation , please , we can not and should not close ourselves off to the most vulnerable members of our society . mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent that the gentlewoman from texas ( ms. jackson-lee ) xz4001990 be permitted to manage the bill on this side of the floor . ",D
"mr. chairman , i thank the manager on the democratic side for yielding me this time . mr. chairman , this amendment was brought to our attention yesterday evening , and at first blush , this is a shocking correlative point to be made and a comparison to the fugitive slave act of 1850 , in which agents were given the broad powers to return freed slaves in free states and return them back to slavery . what we are doing here with bail bondsmen is giving them the ability to enforce immigration laws by summarily rounding up and deporting people and also gaining access to incredible private and secret material in data files . and i just wanted to briefly ask the gentleman from texas ( mr. sessions ) xz4003670 what inspired him to add this to a bill that we already had a considerable number of problems about and have never had any hearings on a provision such as this . ",D
i yield to the gentleman from texas . ,D
"mr. chairman , i need my friend to know that they are in the process of having the claim heard . it has not been terminated or it is not all over . but we are arguing the substance . what i was trying to figure out is , what inspired the gentleman at this late point in the proceedings , since we had hearings last year , we had no hearings this year , and we just found out about this yesterday . ",D
"mr. chairman , i just wanted to ask the author of the amendment , would he have objected to having hearings on his amendment ? ",D
"mr. chairman , i want to thank the gentleman from florida ( mr. meek ) xz4002700 for his work on this . it is credibly important . this is perhaps the most objectionable part of the bill . i rise in support of the nadler/meeks/jackson-lee amendment to strike section 101 of h.r. 418 which imposes evidentiary requirements on asylum-seekers fleeing persecution and all immigrants who seek withholding of removal from deportation . without a doubt , if this section passes into law , genuine bona fide refugees who have fled horrible persecution that qualifies them for protection from our government will be returned to face more terror , torture and death at the hands of their persecutors . chairmen sensenbrenner is using the public 's fear of terrorism to radically change asylum law for all asylees , not just those with some connection to terrorism . section 101 will not make us one bit safer from terrorist attack . since we tightened some loopholes in asylum law in 1996 , terrorists have not been `` abusing our asylum system '' as the proponents of this bill allege . terrorists are already barred from receiving the benefit of asylum protection in the united states . those who support placing these new insurmountable hurdles on asylum-seekers have used examples of known terrorists to allegedly show that the asylum system makes us vulnerable to terrorist attack . but none of the people they talk about were granted asylum . ramzi yousef and sheik omar abdel rahman , who were both involved in the first world trade center bombing in 1993 , were never granted asylum . they filed applications for asylum that had not been adjudicated at the time of the bombing . mir aimal kansi , who killed two cia employees in 1993 , was never granted asylum . he had an asylum application pending at the time of the attack . gazi ibrahim abu mezer , known as `` the brooklyn bomber '' for his involvement in a planned attack on the new york city subway in 1997 , was never granted asylum . he applied for asylum but withdrew his application before it was reviewed . ahmad ajaj , who was involved in the first world trade center bombing , was never granted asylum his initial application for asylum was abandoned when he left the country , and his second application was denied . abdel hakim tizegha , who was involved in the planned millennium attack in 1999 , was never granted asylum . his application was denied in 1997 and his appeal was denied in 1999 . hesham mohamed ali hedayet , who killed two people at the el al counter at los angeles international airport in 2002 , was never granted asylum . his application was denied in 1995 . shahawar matin siraj , who has been accused of plotting to bomb the harold square subway station in new york city in august 2004 , was never granted asylum . he asserts that he entered the united states legally as a teen , and he later filed an application for asylum that was suspended upon his arrest . immigrants can not apply for asylum unless they are already in the united states . so it is not the fault of the asylum system that these terrorists , and terrorist suspects , entered the united states and section 101 of h.r. 418 would not have prevented their entry . in addition , filing an application for asylum should not be equated with actually receiving asylum protection and the right to remain in the united states that it grants . many asylum applications are rejected , just as many tourist visas to enter the united states are rejected . for people applying for asylum in 2005 , under current law , extensive security checks are now done through the fbi , cia , homeland security and state department databases . now , expedited removal rules mandate detention for people arriving without proper documents , and grant dhs authority to detain asylum-seekers throughout the adjudication of their application . expedited processing of asylum claims now exists , and applicants are denied work authorizations that may have been a magnet for false applications before asylum reform . people who are already in the united states , who become terrorists while they are here , must be identified by intelligence and law enforcement . if they are , asylum or any other immigration benefit will be revoked under current law . for that vast majority of asylum applicants who have no nexus to terrorism , other than being victims of it , section 101 will create high , new legal standards of evidence , and will severely limit judicial review of their cases . first , the bill requires that refugees prove that one of the five grounds for asylum protection -- race , nationality , membership in a social group , political opinion , or religion -- is the `` central reason '' why they were persecuted . with little access to the documents and witnesses they left behind when fleeing their country , they must prove what was in the mind of their persecutor during the persecution . this would require an asylum-seeker from darfur , sudan to prove that the janjaweed attacked them and ran them off their land because they were black , and not because the militia wanted to steal the immigrant 's cows , for example . second , the bill requires asylum-seekers to show evidence corroborating their testimony , and it would bar judicial review of decisions regarding that evidence . yet many refugees are unable to flee with the people or paperwork that could back up their stories under evidentiary standards . third , the bill allows judges to deny applications if they find inconsistencies between the applicant 's testimony and any statement they have made to a u.s. official , or inconsistencies in witness and documentary evidence that is provided . in addition , it allows denials on the basis of subjective assessments of an applicant 's demeanor , a factor that is frequently misinterpreted by u.s. judges due to cultural differences . thus , a person could be denied asylum due to an immaterial inconsistency in the evidence they present . finally , the bill strips courts from the power to review immigration judge 's discretionary judgments in asylum and removal cases . unfortunately , this bill takes a significant step in turning our country away from its proud history as a nation of refuge for those fleeing persecution . for these reasons , i urge my colleagues to support the nadler/meeks/jackson-lee amendment to strike section 101 of this bill .

"mr. chairman , what i would like to find out , if the gentleman knows , has this ever occurred in the history of federal legislation before that for a given instance all laws , local , state , national , will be waived all at one time for one specific purpose ? ",D
i thank the gentleman . ,D
"mr. speaker , i rise in strong opposition to this supplemental appropriations bill and the anti-immigrant legislation it contains . if we truly believe all the rhetoric we hear about the importance of freedom and liberty from the president and others , we will vote down this bill , which denies so much freedom and liberty to immigrants in our own country . h.r. 1268 includes numerous provisions limiting the rights of refugees , imposing onerous new driver 's license requirements on the states , making it easier to deport legal immigrants , waiving all federal laws concerning the construction of fences and barriers anywhere within the united states , and denying immigrants long standing habeas corpus rights . if enacted into law , this legislation will close america 's doors to religious minorities escaping religious persecution and women fleeing sex trafficking and rape . we have been down this road of overreaction in the past . during the civil war , general grant sought to expel the jews from the south . the aftermath of world war i brought about the notorious red scare and the anti-immigrant palmer raids . world war ii led to the unconscionable internment of japanese americans . in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy , and even after the patriot act , this legislation would further target immigrants for crimes they have not committed , and sins they are not responsible for . at some point , we have to treat terrorism as a problem that requires an intelligence response , as opposed to an excuse to scapegoat immigrants . it is for all these reasons that so many groups strongly oppose this bill , including groups concerned about immigrant rights , civil rights and liberties , privacy rights ; labor rights ; the environment ; native-american rights ; state rights , and international human rights . i urge a `` no '' vote . we can not and should not close ourselves off to the most vulnerable members of our society .

"mr. chairman , i move to strike the requisite number of words . mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the tierney amendment . this is a lot of money we are talking about . as the late everett dirksen said , a billion here , a billion there , pretty soon you have got some real money . we are talking about $ 200 billion . and we all support our warfighters . we support our men and women in uniform , but we should not throw money at any problem . and all this amendment asks is that we copy the truman commission where a democratic senator investigated a democratic president . this should not be a partisan issue at all . both parties should unite . and i congratulate the gentleman from iowa ( mr. leach ) xz4002360 for his strong work in this worthy effort . republicans should want a real-time bipartisan look at what is really going on . i had the good fortune of being in baghdad last christmas . our c-130 was broken , so we spent a little extra time at the baghdad airport . a shipment came in that our military did not want us to see . but i had my video camera handy , and i took pictures . what was it ? six large pallets , off-loaded from u.s. aircraft , beautifully packaged , you could tell , lots of small boxes on each pallet , very heavy to lift . what was in those boxes ? answer , $ 1.4 billion , billion with a b as in `` boy , '' $ 1.4 billion of u.s. currency shipped in allegedly to replenish the iraqi central bank . well , i hope and pray that was true . but when our own paul bremer says he really can not account for $ 9 billion of money , when eyewitnesses see 300 million in u.s. cash being flown out of the country , allegedly to buy arms for the good guys , you have got to wonder . all we are asking for here is accountability . and i want to pay special tribute to my friend , the gentleman from california ( mr. thompson ) xz4004032 , a leading member of the blue dog coalition . what we want is accountability . we are fiscal and defense hawks , but we need to know where the money goes . the taxpayers of this country deserve no less . this is as far from a partisan issue as you can get . all we want is accountability because catching fraud , waste , and abuse is the most bipartisan of issues . so i congratulate my friend , the gentleman from california ( mr. thompson ) xz4004032 , also the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. tierney ) xz4004070 . this needs to be in the bill because these supplementals , they are becoming a habit , guys . every year we are going to have a major supplemental . and it is high time that we find out where the money went . support the tierney amendment . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . i am happy to join this debate as the chairman of the committee on homeland security and welcome the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. thompson ) xz4004021 , my ranking member . we are here because each day thousands of people illegally enter the united states . they know where to cross . they know how to get a driver 's license . and if they are caught , they even know how to rig our legal system to stay in the country nonetheless . what has been the result of this broken system ? on january 25 , 1993 , mir aimal kansi stood at the entrance of the central intelligence agency and gunned down five people . a month later ramzi yousef masterminded the first bombing of the world trade center . both men were in the country because they were awaiting the outcome of their asylum applications . this legislation will fix that loophole . on september 11 , 2001 , according to the 9/11 commission report , the 19 hijackers responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks carried between them 13 u.s. driver 's licenses and 21 state-issued id cards . several of these hijackers had overstayed their visas , and they were unlawfully in this country . but their driver 's licenses permitted them to board those airplanes nonetheless . this bill fixes that problem . the laws that we are operating under today allow terrorists to enter our country and to plan and carry out attacks in the united states . the reality is that this homeland security vulnerability is being exploited by terrorists and criminal aliens every day . h.r. 418 makes necessary changes to ensure that terrorists do not obtain identification , as did the 9/11 hijackers , that will permit them to board airplanes or access federal facilities or easily travel within the united states . the most literal security gap that this bill addresses is the 3-mile hole in the san diego border fence . recent press accounts have reported that al qaeda operatives have joined forces with human smuggling rings in order to enter the united states . as we now know , the 9/11 hijackers were interviewed 25 times by u.s. consular officers ; they had 43 contacts with immigration and customs authorities . but because of administration and congressional initiatives requiring the screening of all foreign nationals entering the united states , terrorists will be forced to resort to crossing our borders illegally . the border security fence , therefore , which thus far has been mired in bureaucratic delays , is part of our national security efforts and must be completed now . for decades the border between san diego and mexico has been the preferred corridor for entry into the united states by unknown or undocumented persons . with highly populated cities both north and south of the border as well as relatively quick access to national transportation hubs such as lax , it is the perfect place for aliens to slip across the border and gain quick access to u.s. communities and transportation networks . the important infrastructure assets in the area , including in particular the largest naval base on the west coast of the united states and the busiest seaport in the united states , makes securing this area even more important . from september through november , 2004 , the border patrol apprehended over 23 , 000 individuals with criminal records including 84 wanted for murder and 151 wanted for sexual assault . in 2004 border patrol agents arrested almost 1.2 million illegal aliens with 11.6 percent of those apprehended in the san diego sector alone , despite the fact that the san diego sector is roughly 1 percent of our border area . over the past 2 years , the three border patrol stations responsible for patrol of the existing 14 miles of border fence in the san diego sector have apprehended approximately 200 special interest aliens annually from countries such as afghanistan , iran , iraq , pakistan , and turkey . completion of this fence will not only reduce the number of illegal crossings in the area but will also allow the border patrol to redeploy manpower and redirect precious resources to other important homeland security missions along the border . and like the other border fence areas , the san diego sector can expect to see a reduction in crime , including murder , as well . of the 14 miles authorized by congress several times , 9 miles of the triple fence have been completed . but only in washington would people construct a fence with a big hole in it . the final 3 1/2 miles has been held up due to bureaucratic red tape and lawsuits . the border patrol has worked to alleviate the environmental concerns that have been raised . in fact , the u.s. department of the interior 's fish and wildlife service concluded in july , 2003 , that construction of the fence `` is not likely to jeopardize '' the continued existence of any relevant endangered species in the area . furthermore , not completing the fence will continue to cause other environmental damage in the area due to large numbers of persons crossing illegally through this area and subsequent pursuit by the border patrol , as well as large amounts of trash and refuse left in the wake of smugglers and illegal crossers . as chairman of the committee on homeland security and a california resident , i am extremely concerned by the roadblocks that different bureaucratic groups have used to justify thwarting this important project . for example , in september of 2003 , the san diego border patrol requested entry to a section of county-owned land located in the 3 1/2 mile section in dispute and located about 300 feet from the u.s.-mexican border in order to , first , improve the road for safety of the border patrol agents ; and , two , take soil samples in order to address environmental concerns pertaining to construction of the fence . but the san diego county department of parks and recreation denied access , saying there was no authority to enter upon the land . after months of negotiation , i have been told that the issue was finally resolved , but this clearly demonstrates that federal action is necessary to ensure that the fence is completed and that border security remains a priority . the time for delay and bureaucratic obstruction is over . we must complete this fence , and we must pass h.r. 418 . mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .

"mr. chairman , several provisions in this legislation are of particular interest to the committee on homeland security . first , this spending bill will be procedurally consolidated with the real id act , which the house approved 261-161 on february 10 , 2005 . we can not effectively fight terrorism if we can not verify the identity of people boarding airplanes , entering nuclear power plants , visiting the white house , or gaining access to any of the countless places a terrorist could use as a stage to multiply the effect of an attack . accurate identification of individuals before permitting them access to critical infrastructure is a prerequisite to success . the failure to ensure the integrity of identification documents that can be legally used to access critical infrastructure means that the entire process of checking ids is deeply flawed . likewise , the time and effort of every law abiding citizen who waits in seemingly endless lines , first to obtain and then to present identification , is wasted . document fraud is a crime against all americans who must tolerate the indignity of life in a post-9/11 world . why must honest americans prove who we are , again and again , if terrorists and criminals are free to make a hash of this requirement ? five weeks ago , the house approved the real id act , just as we did in the 108th congress . in so doing , we responded to the challenge put before us by mir aimal kansi , who slaughtered five people at cia headquarters ; by ramzi yousef , who masterminded the first world trade center attack ; and by several of the 9/11 hijackers who would have found it far more difficult , if not impossible , to carry out their terror attacks had we prevented them from using false identification . this spending bill also contains funding to secure our borders . to secure our nation from nuclear attack , the legislation includes $ 55 million to detect nuclear material at foreign ports . the megaports initiative is designed to interdict illicit traffic in nuclear and other radioactive materials . by surveilling container shipping at high volume , high risk overseas ports , and by deploying radiation detection devices at our own ports of entry , america 's counter-terrorism strategy can succeed in a comprehensive defense of the global supply chain . this bill also provides $ 38.97 million for the terrorist screening center . this multi-agency homeland security effort is responsible for supporting the department of homeland security 's effort to screen passengers on both domestic and international flights . this new funding will help the tsc to handle new requirements , such as the department of homeland security 's secure flight program . ",R
"mr. speaker , while i have problems with the concept of this supplemental and supplementals , and the misplaced budget priorities of the republican party , this bill , i believe , is needed for our men and women who are fighting the war on terrorism . this bill includes much needed higher death benefits for our military . and while it will never return these patriots such as christian engeldrum in my district to his family , what we can do as americans is ensure that his wife and children have financial security for his personal sacrifice to his country . this bill finally provides funding for body armor for our troops , something that this administration has refused to do for over 2 years now . so hopefully less families can claim the new death benefits for their loved ones fighting overseas . this bill provides much needed aid for the victims of the december tsunami . i led a delegation to sri lanka in january , and i saw first hand the resources needed in that country , multiplied by the effects on other countries ; and this money will go to good use . this funding , along with the sheer generosity of the american people , is a true testament of our country in comparison to the tepid actions by the white house in the immediate days after the crisis . while this money is important , i would be remiss if i did not express my disappointment at no funding being included for the u.n . population fund for children and maternal health care in the tsunami region . i offered an amendment to fix this , but yet again this administration has played politics and refuses to fund the unfpa . this bill provides $ 50 million in important aid to the state of israel as they embark on the critical disengagement plan and withdraw from the gaza strip . we have the support , the courage of the israeli people ; and this is the right thing to do at this time . and , finally , this bill includes important language to create the 9/11 heroes medal of valor , for which i am deeply indebted to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. wolf ) xz4004350 , the gentleman from new york ( mr. serrano ) xz4003660 , the gentleman from ohio ( mr. oxley ) xz4003070 , and the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. frank ) xz4001400 for including this provision in this bill . on behalf of my cousin , john moran , who was killed on 9/11 , a battalion chief of the fire department of new york , and the over 400 families in new york city that are affected by this legislation , i want to say thank you for this honor that is going to be bestowed by the president in september of this year . ",D
"mr. chairman , on september 11th , the terrorists did n't just use box cutters and airplanes to attack america , they used our own laws against us to help them murder thousands of people . h.r. 418 , the real id act , will fix these loopholes in current law and also take steps to close gaping holes in our land borders , which are the first line of defense against terrorist infiltration , not just for the border states , but also for my home state of wyoming and the rest of the nation . we all know how the 9/11 terrorists manipulated our asylum laws to stay in our country , and utilized lax drivers ' license standards to help them carry out their plans . we know that human traffickers continue to take advantage of the gaps in our borders , helping terrorist and criminal aliens gain entry into our country . yet some still question the need to turn this invaluable knowledge into meaningful action . as an original cosponsor of the real id act , i ask my colleagues to look beyond the false rhetoric that has clouded this debate and realize what is really at stake -- the safety and security of our nation . i refuse to gamble with the lives of american citizens , rolling the dice on flawed policies that have already failed to protect us against terrorism . today we have the opportunity -- and more importantly , the responsibility -- to pass this legislation and make the terrorist handbook obsolete . ",R
"mr. chairman , i reject the statement made a minute ago that this is an anti-immigration bill . i support the sensenbrenner bill . i think security is a national issue . but to suggest that this is an anti-immigrant bill is , in my opinion , wrong . we support legal immigration into this country . it is what has made this country so great . but we also need to take care of security . if you want to come in on a visa , you want to come in to be a citizen , support it . but if you are here illegally , it is wrong . each year i have one family , just last year , the father survived . the wife died . he lost a child to illegal immigrants . i wish that was the only case . each year we have several of these . illegal immigrants driving and causing accidents , and people say , well , they are here ; they have got to go to work . well , they will go to work if we can get them to be legal . but not if they are here illegally . if they are in this country illegally , they need to go out and come back legally with a visa or proper method . and that is why i support the sensenbrenner bill , to make sure we do not have metricula cards , we do not have driver 's licenses to illegals , and that the driver 's license has a clip to ensure that it is proper by the federal government . ",R
"mr. chairman , i would say to my friend , the gentleman from california ( mr. farr ) xz4001290 , during the last debate i invited him to come down and look at the 7-mile area in that fence , because it is a problem . i am looking forward to working with him , because if you are an environmentalist , it is hard pan . i mean , it has totally destroyed the plants , the animals , the lizards , and it is like a venturi tube . the gentleman from california ( mr. hunter ) xz4001910 first came to me in 1990 and asked where we could get landing mat , and we put that up . why ? because the number of rapes of mexicans who were coming across , the number of drugs that were coming across . there is one strand of wire on the ground where you could just drive from one field to another with a loaded truck , and it has stopped a lot of that . does the fence stop illegal immigration ? no . but it sure frees up a lot of the border patrol and makes it easier for them , and that 7 miles is like a venturi tube and it forces our border patrol into that area . i agree with the gentleman from texas ( mr. reyes ) xz4003370 , and i am going to work with anybody over there , especially him , because he does have the expertise and he is a good friend . i agree with him that the president 's budget does not include the funding . but no clinton budget ever passed either , and we are going to add that ; and with the help of my friend , we are going to add the funding for those new border patrol . ",R
"mr. chairman , the gentleman from california ( mr. hunter ) xz4001910 talked about , in 1990 , when he came to me while i was still in the military asking me about landing mats to put up for the border . he and i have actually been down there welding to get that up . why ? why would we do that ? take this floor , if this was a farmer 's field and you had a single strand of wire that was lying on the ground , that is what separated the united states and mexico . we had truckloads of drugs coming across in a 100-mile sector that we could not stop . in 1 year , there were a number of rapes and a number of murders by the coyotes and people on the u.s. side of people trying to get across . when my colleague arranged to put up that fence , it stopped all of it . now , there are all kinds of ways in which you can stop something here in this body . we can have hearings and say we are going to do this or that , but with the fence area , these 7 miles , another way is to waive the environmental things . the gentleman from california ( mr. hunter ) xz4001910 also showed that president clinton did this . if we do not do this , my colleagues , we will not get it done . and it will help security . documents that we have captured from al qaeda show that they consider the border vulnerable , with cells in mexico itself . and so it is not just sealing off the border for security , but it is other things too . in san diego , in california , we have about 800 , 000 illegals in k-through-12 education . use half of that , use 400 , 000 . that is $ 2 billion a year out of california . that does not account for the $ 1.5 million a day for the school lunch . now , i can not stop those kids . i have been in those schools . there is no way i would take that lunch away from those critters . but we need to secure our border to stop the flow coming in . if we know , with the bill of the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , who is there legally , it is much easier to tell who is there illegally . so i ask my colleagues to give this support because we really need to complete this . ",R
"mr. chairman , i rise to oppose my friend 's amendment . i will tell you why personally . i spent a lot of time in saudi . they can either go the wrong way or the right way . we talk about not putting foreign troops in foreign countries . do they have problems ? yes . but when you talk about the government itself , i know from the intelligence community , i also know how they are helping us there ; but i have been into their banks where they have canadian and u.s. and british auditors to make sure there is no money laundering . the government itself , i have met with king aziz , i have met with the crown prince , i have met with almost every one of the shura council , which is their congress . the majority of saudis support the united states . so to say that their government is against us is wrong . are there people that preach wahabism ? yes . but they have changed their inside curriculum . they have arrested and jailed over 1 , 000 imams which preach intolerance . so i would oppose the gentleman 's amendment . i did not know when we were on the floor that we had an amendment when i went over there . it really hurts people when we do things , and i think that this could hurt our relationship instead of bettering it with saudi arabia . i oppose the gentleman 's amendment .

"mr. chairman , i rise today out of frustration with h.r. 1268 , the emergency supplemental wartime appropriations act . i support passage of this legislation , as i believe it is absolutely necessary to continue to fund the important activities of our brave men and women fighting the global war on terrorism . our men and women depend on having the necessary equipment and systems to be successful in mission accomplishment . as a member of the house armed services committee , i am actively involved in efforts , for example , to better protect our troops while they are in harm 's way . with that said , the inclusion of spending projects within this bill that certainly do not qualify as either `` emergency '' or `` wartime '' is outrageous . the issue at hand is not whether or not it is necessary to fund the noble efforts of our soldiers , for that answer is self-evident . rather , the question is about our responsibility to spend the american people 's money wisely , and in a manner consistent with the established process . i do not doubt that the non-wartime , and non-defense related projects in this bill are worthwhile ; however , the decision to fund these projects should be made during the established appropriations process . certainly , it is inappropriate for this body to have to consider legislation under the guise of emergency , wartime spending , when in fact , that description is not completely honest . again , i support this funding legislation as it pertains to the support of our military , and our efforts to protect american citizens , and to promote peace and democracy in the middle east . however , i do not support the inclusion of unrelated projects within this bill , and find it most unfortunate that members of congress are forced to vote on such legislation .

"mr. chairman , i want to thank my colleague from monterey for so clearly laying out the reasons that waiving all laws is a travesty of american governing principles . i will focus on the issue driving this extreme language -- completing the 3 1/2 miles of border fencing , including the ocean section in my district . a member stated that tens of thousands of illegal immigrants enter there and are chased all over the sensitive wetlands destroying them anyway . his facts were true 10 years ago . they are not today . in 1993 , the border patrol apprehended 165 , 000 people in this section . in 2003 , the number had dropped 94 percent -- to 10 , 000 . how many illegal entrants get past the border patrol today ? they tell us 1 , 000 a year -- three people per day . and that is with a fence you or i could easily walk around or through . what should we do ? finish building a secondary fence with the proposed level of environmental destruction . compromise has occurred , and plans exist for alternative road alignment . appoint a task force to meet and reach consensus by a deadline . one issue remains -- a one-half mile wide river bed called smuggler 's gulch -- leading to internationally recognized wetlands restored at the cost of tens of millions of dollars . the proposal lops off two adjacent mesas to dump 2 million tons of dirt into the gap to a height of 165 feet ! -- as high as two of the new giant airbuses stacked on top of one another ! it would cost $ 40 million just to move the dirt -- money better spent purchasing high grade technology and funding the president 's proposed increase of border patrol agents . i urge you to support the farr amendment .

"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . i rise today in support of h.r. 418 . i want to thank my colleague from wisconsin for his leadership and tireless efforts to secure our nation 's borders . last year , the congress passed the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act , enacting into law many of the recommendations made by the 9/11 commission . unfortunately , not all of the recommendations were included in the first round of legislation , which is why we are here today . the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) and i committed to working together to make sure that one of the first orders of business considered by the house in the 109th congress would be to address some of the recommendations in our jurisdictions that the congress failed to address last year . i want to use my time today to discuss the provisions contained in h.r. 418 that fall within the jurisdiction of the committee on government reform which i chair : security measures for federal acceptance of state-issued driver 's licenses and personal identification cards , commonly referred to as identity security . last year 's 9/11 commission report identified a number of gaps and weaknesses in our nation 's intelligence and homeland security systems , providing recommendations for congress to consider in fixing these problems . one of the most pressing recommendations proposed by the commission and one that fell within the jurisdiction of the committee on government reform appears on page 390 of the 9/11 commission report . it is the following : secure identification should begin in the united states . the federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification , such as driver 's licenses . fraud in identity documents is no longer just a problem of theft . at many entry points to vulnerable facilities , including gates for boarding aircraft , sources of identification are the last opportunity to ensure that people are who they say they are and to check whether they are terrorists . for terrorists , travel documents are as important as weapons . the 9/11 hijackers relied on a wide variety of fraudulent documents . we know that the 19 hijackers held 63 driver 's licenses or id cards . based upon guidelines proposed by state motor vehicle administrators and adopted by a number of states throughout the country , our committee worked with other interested stakeholders to craft legislation that would establish minimum standards to be accepted of state-issued identification that could be used for federal purposes . these important provisions were overwhelmingly passed by the house as part of h.r. 10 and heralded by the 9/11 victims ' families . unfortunately , the house-passed provisions critical to strengthening identity security were dropped from the bill in conference . instead , language was included that would set up a general framework for a federal role in this area , but the language was filled with so many loopholes and opt-out clauses for states that it really only made matters worse . we find ourselves here today to correct these mistakes and to again enact meaningful reform . h.r. 418 provides the congress with this opportunity . our approach is very straightforward . our legislation would set forth minimum document and issuance standards for federal acceptance of driver 's licenses and state-issued personal identification cards . the legislation would provide 3 years for states to come into compliance with these standards if their driver 's licenses are to be recognized for federal government purposes and their documents as proof of an individual 's identity . as the 9/11 commission concluded , fraud in identity documents is no longer just a problem of theft . as we continue to strengthen our intelligence function to better identify and track terrorists , those individuals will be forced to find ways to conceal their identity in order to avoid detection . we know that the 9/11 hijackers used the united states as their staging area for training and preparation in the year prior to the attacks , traveling into and out of and around the country with little fear of capture . in fact , several of the hijackers lived less than 15 miles away from this building while making final preparations for their attack . we are dedicated to making sure we do not provide such a hospitable environment in the future . as chairman of the committee that oversees federalism issues , i am mindful of concerns about the federal government imposing burdens on states , so-called unfunded mandates . my response is threefold . one is that this is a national security issue that requires a unified national response rather than 50 separate responses . secondly , the legislation authorizes grants to states to conform to the minimum standards set forth in the act . third , i am confident that these minimum standards will not be a heavy lift for a majority of the states in our nation . it is the handful of states that continue to have lax security standards more than 3 years after 9/11 that may have the most work to do . it is crucial that we do everything we can to enhance the security of the american people , and this important legislation takes a significant step in frustrating terrorists ' attempts to integrate into our society . i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 418 and strengthen identity security . mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .

"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . let me just sum up and say this does not require anything from the states as far as driver 's licenses go . states do not have to do anything under this for their driver 's licenses . they can issue driver 's licenses to whomever they want . but if they intend to use those licenses for federal purposes , we have a right to say what the criteria should be and under those circumstances , they are going to have to show legal presence . it is not anti-immigrant . in fact , this allows the states to issue two different sets : one for illegal immigrants , one for everyone else . it takes the national security issue away from the argument there . finally , the opt-out provisions in the current legislation that was passed just a few months ago are disastrous . we were worse with the 9/11 response that passed this congress than we were without it . this rectifies that . it closes that loophole . out of respect for the victims , the families , the work of the 9/11 commission , i urge my colleagues to support this legislation . mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . ",R
"mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of the conference report on h.r. 1268 and urge all my colleagues to support it . in addition to necessary funding for our troops , tsunami disaster relief , and border security ; this conference report also includes important provisions to bring long-overdue , common sense reform to drivers ' licenses and state-issued identification cards , authored last year by the government reform committee in response to a recommendation of the 9-11 commission . mr. speaker , i want to especially thank the speaker and majority leader for making good on their promise to get this legislation to the floor signed into law quickly in the 109th congress . i also want to thank my colleague from california , the chairman of the appropriations committee , for his strong support and for agreeing to include these provisions in h.r , 1268 . finally , i would like to thank my colleague from wisconsin for his tireless work and support on this issue , last year following passage of the 9-11 commission recommendations implementation act , he and i made a commitment to work together to ensure that the most important provisions not addressed in the final bill would be addressed early in the 109th congress . that commitment is being fulfilled today . judging by the basic nature of these requirements as well as the actions taken by some states , it is quite obvious that not enacting these reforms does not come from a lack of ability , but from a lack of will . the federal government can not continue to allow our security responsibilities to be compromised by the inaction of a few . our approach is very straightforward . building upon guidelines and best practices established and accepted by state motor vehicle administrators , the federal government 's long-standing work on identity security , and actions taken by individual states to shore up their licensing process following the terrorist attacks ; our legislation sets forth minimum document and issuance standards for federal acceptance of driver 's licenses and state-issued personal identification cards . the legislation provides three years for states to come into compliance with these standards in order for the federal government to recognize their documents as proof of an individual 's identity . let me make one thing perfectly clear . states that want their drivers ' licenses to be used for federal identification purposes will be required to meet these standards . all of them . if they do not , the citizens of that state will not be able to use their driver 's license to identify themselves for many purposes that they use them for today , such as boarding an airplane . the bill and the report make clear that the secretary must determine the uses , in addition to those set forth in the bill , for which drivers licenses only from complying states will be accepted . importantly , the final bill makes clear that the secretary of homeland security will be responsible for ensuring that the certifications represent full compliance . this requirement ensures that the national security interests of the united states will be protected through enforcement of the requirements of the bill . states will also be required to confirm the applicant 's proof of legal presence in the united states . currently , only 11 states lack such a requirement , meaning a majority of states have already recognized the need for tighter standards , but unnecessary and dangerous gaps in the system still exist . importantly , states are still permitted to issue drivers ' licenses to individuals who are not lawfully present in the united states or who can not provide satisfactory proof of identity . the ability of states to have such a system is currently under challenge in court , and this legislation will provide them with express authority . the bill further provides that these licenses or identification cards must be clearly visually differentiated from other licenses and contain specific language regarding their validity for federal identification and other official purposes . in addition , the legislation will require identity documents to expire at the same time as the expiration of lawful entry status -- this will prevent individuals who have illegally entered or are unlawfully present in the united states from having valid identification documents . this loophole was highlighted on september 11th , as nawaf al hazmi and hani hanjour , the pilots of flight 77 , both obtained licenses and identification cards after the expiration of their visa authorization . we must correct this dangerous problem before we again give individuals who have overstayed their visas the tools they need to integrate into society and carry out criminal and terrorist acts . mr. speaker , it is important to note that these actions are consistent with actions taken by individual states to date . for example , nevada and new mexico do not accept , as proof of identity , a state-issued driver license or identification card from states that do not meet their own standards . the federal government has been delinquent in dealing with this issue , but we are correcting that problem today . fraud in identity documents is no longer just a problem of theft . as we continue to strengthen our intelligence function to better identify and track terrorists , those individuals will be forced to find ways to conceal their identity in order to avoid detection . we must be able to establish , as close to certainty as we can , that people are who they say they are , and in order to do so the federal government must have documents that it can trust . in fact , we would not be fulfilling our security role for the american people if we did not . mr. speaker , i urge my colleagues to support these important provisions and the passage of this conference report . ",R
"mr. speaker , i want to comment briefly on the $ 82 billion spending bill that will be approved today for the ongoing u.s. military campaigns in iraq and afghanistan . i will support this bill . i am pleased it includes additional money for body armor and armored vehicles for our troops . it includes money to purchase bomb-jamming devices to protect our troops from roadside bombs . i also support the improved life insurance death benefits for military personnel and their families . and , i am hopeful that the additional funds that are in the bill to train and equip security forces in iraq all afghanistan will be expeditious and well spent . this money is critical if afghan and iraqi forces are to take over security duties from american troops , which will allow our men and women to finally come home . i have called for negotiating a timeline for the withdrawal of american troops with the new iraqi government , hopefully to be completed within the year . but , for that to become a reality , well-equipped and competent security forces in iraq and afghanistan must be prepared to take our place . this bill will help achieve that goal . i am also pleased that the final bill retained language inserted in the senate directing the president to include future requests to fund the u.s. presence in iraq in his regular budget . we have been in iraq for more than two years and in afghanistan for more than three years . the fact that we still have troops in iraq should not come as a surprise to the budget writers at the white house and the pentagon . it is not appropriate to continue funding these long-term , ongoing operations via supplemental appropriations bills , which are considered outside of the normal budget procedures and restrictions . while i support the bill , i am outraged that , more than two years after the u. s. invaded iraq , the pentagon leadership has not gotten their act together to adequately protect our troops and to come up with a plan to get them home . as columnist mark shields pointed out late last year , in the three years immediately after pearl harbor , the united states produced the following to win world war ii : 296 , 429 aircraft , 102 , 3351 tanks , 87 , 620 warships , and 2 , 455 , 694 trucks . at the time , the u.s. population was 132 million and the size of our economy was less than $ 100 billion . yet , approaching three years into the u.s. occupation of iraq , the united states , with a population of almost 300 million and defense spending of $ 500 billion a year , under the failed leadership of the pentagon , only 6 , 000 of the nearly 20 , 000 humvees in iraq are factory armored versions and more than 8 , 000 of the 9 , 128 medium and heavy trucks used in iraq are without armor . despite repeated promises from the pentagon leadership that the situation is getting better , a recent article in the new york times showed that the emperor has no clothes . as the article details , one marine company has returned home to expose the reality of their tour in iraq , `` one they say was punctuated not only by a lack of armor , but also by a shortage of men and planning that further hampered their efforts in battle , destroyed morale and ruined the careers of some of their most competent warriors. '' i have heard similar stories from the oregon national guard members i have talked to . how did this happen ? since the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks against our country ; congress has provided the pentagon with $ 1.6 trillion -- $ 167 billion in supplemental appropriations bills for fiscal years 2001-2005 ; and $ 1.45 trillion in regular defense appropriations for fiscal years 2002-2005 . today 's bill will add $ 75 billion or so to the pentagon budget . given that level of funding , it is hard to understand why our troops continue to suffer shortages of critical equipment . it is hard to understand until you remember that secretary rumsfeld and the other civilian leaders at the pentagon argued that our troops would be greeted in iraq as liberators with flowers and candy , not the bullets and bombs that have led to more than 1 , 500 of our soldiers getting killed . before , the invasion , the pentagon planned to reduce our troop levels to 20 , 000-30 , 000 within a few weeks of overthrowing saddam hussein . the fact that 150 , 000 u.s. troops remain in iraq more than a year and a half after the war began shows how badly the pentagon leadership miscalculated the post-war situation . those miscalculations also led the pentagon to vastly underestimate the equipment that our troops would need to survive and succeed in iraq . first , the pentagon leadership did not even order the necessary equipment like body armor , armored humvees and bomb jamming devices . for example , under the pentagon 's original war plan , the pentagon planned to have only 235 armored humvees in iraq for the 20 , 000 troops who would remain after overthrowing saddam hussein . then , when it became clear that this equipment was necessary , the pentagon did not procure it with any sense of urgency . as the new york times article i mentioned above noted , `` the army 's procurement system , which also supplies the marines , has come under fierce criticism for underperforming in the war , and to this day it has only one small contractor in ohio armoring new humvees. '' the performance of secretary rumsfeld and his senior leadership at the pentagon has been a disgrace . unfortunately , it is our troops who have had to pay the price . ",D
"mr. speaker , i thank the distinguished whip , the gentleman from maryland , for yielding to me . mr. speaker , the house will convene on tuesday at 2 p.m . for legislative business . we will consider several measures under suspension of the rules . a final list of those bills will be sent to members ' offices by the end of the week . any votes called on those measures will be rolled until 6 : 30 p.m . on wednesday and thursday , the house will convene at 10 a.m . we likely will consider additional legislation under suspension of the rules , as well as h.r. 418 , the real id act of 2005 . finally , i would like to remind members that we do not plan , do not plan , to have votes next friday , february 11 . and i thank the gentleman for yielding to me , and i would be happy to answer any questions he may have . ",R
"mr. speaker , if the gentleman will continue to yield , i would assume that the committee on rules would follow a process similar to the one that they followed for the rest of the 9/11 commission 's recommendations , and that is to have a structured rule that allows for a variety of amendments . but i will let the chairman of the committee on rules make announcements on that and reserve decisions for the committee on what those amendments will be . i can tell the gentleman that we are contemplating , although actions by the committee on rules will need to be taken , contemplating a rule that would merge the border security bill into another bill , another must-pass piece of legislation , not knowing what that would be . but , obviously , the supplement could be a candidate for that . ",R
that is correct . ,R
"we are contemplating several major pieces of legislation that we would hope to complete before the easter break , and we are also contemplating several bills that we contemplate completing prior to the presidents ' day district work period . the comprehensive energy bill , which we passed in the last congress and in the 107th congress , is a very high priority for this year . there is a good chance that we could consider a national energy policy bill before the presidents ' day district work period . ",R
"well , mr. speaker , if the gentleman will continue to yield , i would just say that the gentleman is right . we will try our best to reach out and make this bill as bipartisan as possible . i would just remind the gentleman that this bill , this energy package , has passed , i can not recall every time , but many times in the last congress ; and it even passed this house as a conference report . each time that the energy bill has gone through this house , whether it be the house bill or in the conference report , it has enjoyed a very large democrat vote . so , yes , i would hope that the chairmen of the respective committees that have a piece of this bill , and i would also remind the gentleman that the committee on ways and means has a very big piece of this bill , would reach out to their ranking members and work to put together as bipartisan a bill as possible . ",R
"i appreciate the gentleman yielding to me , mr. speaker . we have not discussed any rule . actually , we are discussing with the relevant committee chairmen whether we can get it that quickly or not . but i would imagine that the committee on rules would have the same sort of rule that we have had on this bill for the last couple of years . so i would not see anything changing . ",R
"mr. chairman , i would just say to my good friend from texas ( mr. reyes ) xz4003370 , who is an expert , and we all value his input , we are going to do immigration reform in this congress . we are looking forward to working with him on immigration reform . but what we are here today about is border security , border security and closing loopholes . i just want to thank both sides of the aisle for the thoughtful way that they have conducted this debate . i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) and the gentleman from virginia ( chairman tom davis ) and the gentleman from california ( chairman cox ) for their hard work in getting this bill to the floor so early in the new session . of all of the issues being debated before us today , the controversy i find most confusing is the section regarding the standardization of driver 's licenses . after all , mr. chairman , the war on terror is not being fought in a vacuum . there was a time , to be sure , when identification fraud was a matter of concern principally to bouncers and bartenders , but that was before september 11 , 2001 . since that day , mr. chairman , id fraud has represented a clear and present danger to the national security of the united states , plain and simple . without standards for the issuance or content of driver 's licenses , the american people are needlessly put at risk . as long as america boasts the civilized world 's most open laws concerning immigration and mobility while remaining its greatest terrorist target , we must ensure that people coming in and out of our country are not here to do our people harm . when someone enters this country and can get a driver 's license , he can board a plane , open a bank account , and get a job . if he plans to do these things not to make a better life for himself , but with the express intent of killing americans , and that treachery could be curbed simply by reforming the way we issue driver 's licenses , how can we not ? the real id act requires that applicants for driver 's licenses prove that they are in the united states legally , very simple , and that a foreign traveler 's license expires with his visa . these are hardly draconian measures , mr. chairman , nor are the sections of the bill that strengthen our deportation and asylum processes . these processes are not just loopholes ; they are gaping , yawning chasms in the law waiting to be exploited . they are risks , threats even , to the security of our homeland and to our success in the war on terror . the reforms in the real id act are overdue , no less an authority than the 9/11 commission itself says so . so i just urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation to further help ensure that such events as three septembers ago never again scar our homeland . ",R
"mr. chairman , i rise in strong opposition to h.r. 418 , the real id act . not only has the house failed to consider the sweeping changes in this bill through the thoughtful and deliberative committee process , we have failed our duty to the american people to ensure that this bill will not have unintended consequences . you may ask , `` dingell , what unintended consequences ? does n't this bill just keep the bad guys from harming us again ? `` well , my friends , read the fine print . look at section 102 of the bill . that section allows the secretary of homeland security to waive any and all federal , state , or local law that the secretary determines should be waived to ensure the construction of physical barriers and roads to deter illegal border crossings . it would also allow waiver of laws to knock down existing structures or other obstacles . it would give power to the secretary of homeland security to waive any public health law such as the safe drinking water act , the clean water act , as well as transportation safety , hazardous materials transportation and road construction standards . in addition , it would grant dhs unchecked authority to abrogate criminal law , child labor laws , laws that protect workers , civil rights laws , ethics laws for clean contracting and procurement policy . it goes even further . no procedures for using this authority are established , and judicial review by federal or state courts is expressly prohibited . it even appears there would be no judicial review concerning the taking of private property . the breadth of this provision is unprecedented and must not stand . now let 's look at section 101 . this section requires that in certain asylum claims , applicants must prove that their race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social group , or political opinion `` was or will be a central reason '' for their persecution . in effect , this will bar many legitimate refugees who have fled brutal human rights abuses , including torture , rape , and other horrific violence , from receiving asylum . this section creates new burdens on those seeking asylum , including a corroborating evidence test , empowering an immigration officer or immigration judge to deny asylum to a refugee because he believes , in his discretion , that the refugee should have somehow been able to obtain a particular document when fleeing her country . mr. chairman , i understand that we must protect our borders , but we must still allow those decent freedom loving people fleeing their countries to be able to continue to seek asylum . i would also note that sec . 103 specifically identifies officers , officials , representatives or spokesmen of the palestinian liberation organization as terrorists , thus not able to enter the united states . mr. speaker , this would mean that palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas would be barred from the united states . given the great progress we have seen in the middle east in the past week and that the bush administration is in the process of setting up meetings with dr . abbas in washington , it hardly seems wise to pass a bill barring the newly elected president of the palestinian authority from the country . finally , i note that i have concerns about this bill and its unintended consequences on the second amendment rights of gun owning americans like myself . section 203 calls for the linking of databases and creates a floor for the requirements of what can be included in the database . however , this legislation fails to create a ceiling . what could stop a state from requiring databases to contain information about gun licenses issued and gun ownership records ? mr. chairman , i urge my colleagues to oppose this broad overreaching legislation . let 's have hearings . let 's have real deliberation and debate . i will vote against this legislation . ",D
"mr. speaker , i rise in support of the war supplemental appropriations act but must voice my incredible misgivings for what the republican majority has attached to legislation that should solely be about how we provide for our brave men and women in harm 's way in iraq and afghanistan . there is much in this bill to be proud of . our military , despite the job of the civilian brass and this congress , have been performing heroically . they have accomplished much more than we could have ever hoped for , and if any fault needs to be assigned it is to the policy makers , and not to those in uniform . however , i am ashamed that this body has taken something as important as securing our troops , and attached a hastily considered immigration provision that will result in massive unfunded mandates being passed on to our states . i am ashamed that the conference committee removed language that would have created a truman-style commission to examine war profiteering , largely to ensure that this administration would not be embarrassed . finally , i am ashamed that this congress has turned its back on a promise made by our president to the palestinian authority to help improve the situation of the palestinian people and further the cause of peace for all in the middle east . i am concerned that the immigration provisions will force our great nation to turn our back on the thousands of political and human rights asylum seekers who look toward america as their last and best hope . the real id act will force the most vulnerable to have their torturers corroborate their tales of persecution . i understand that we must protect our borders , and i understand that changes must be made to keep out those that seek to do us harm . but we should not hastily foreclose the dream and promise of america because of fear . we should not send back asylum seekers back to their torturers . under these standards , iraqis seeking to escape the rape rooms of saddam hussein would have been sent back to the ba'athist prisons if they fled iraq without the proper documentation . i am also dismayed that rather than seeking to be responsible stewards of the public 's trust , the republican majority in charge of congress once again decided to ignore its oversight responsibilities . it seems that rather than doing our oversight job as a separate and equal branch of government , the gop leadership would rather save the bush administration and corporate ceos some embarrassment . i am old enough to remember the truman commission . i remember that sen . truman went against a democratic administration , and saved our military and our tax payers billions of dollars in waste and fraud . i can not understand why we do not do the same . my friends on the other side of the aisle should be ashamed of the fact that mr. waxman xz4004250 and i have probably done more on this front from the minority , than has anyone with a gavel . reconstructing iraq and afghanistan is too important not to get it right , but confronted yet again with evidence of massive fraud and egregious war profiteering , my republican colleagues are again choosing to bury their heads in the sand , plug their ears , and turn out the lights on our duty . finally , this bill , by intention or not , has the potential of undoing all the progress that the middle east peace process has made since the death of yasser arafat . mr. speaker , the new president of the palestinian authority is in an almost untenable position . in order for palestinian democracy to succeed over radical terrorism , president abbas must be provided with the resources to open hospitals , create jobs , arm a police force , build jails , and take the fight to the terrorists . president bush recognized this . he made a statement asking for $ 200 million to support a nascent middle eastern democracy . instead of allowing president abbas to use american aid to build his security forces to take on terror , we instead set him up for failure . my friends , if you want to see hamas win the upcoming municipal elections ; if you want to see the peace process come to an abject halt ; if you want to see more dead young israelis and young palestinians you should support this language . it surprises me that the only thing that this congress is capable of bucking and embarrassing this administration on is the prospect of peace . i hope , for the sake of peace , we can correct this colossal error in judgment and that the president and the state department speak out against congress ' ill-advised policy making on this most tragic conflict . ",D
"mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me time . mr. speaker , the real id act is a real travesty . it has little to do with homeland security , and it represents just the latest in a string of anti-immigrant proposals so unfortunately popular with certain of our republican colleagues . instead of putting the safety of our families first , these are the same folks that would have turned our emergency room doctors into border patrol agents ; who would have cut the funding to cities that did not conduct immigration raids ; and who would interfere with the people with whom our private banking institutions could serve and encourage instead an underground , black market financial system . this same anti-immigrant fervor continues to fuel this bad bill . the real id act is designed to make our roads real unsafe . undocumented workers will be on our roads . that is why the austin police department believes that texans would be safer if the law allowed all drivers to obtain licenses . as assistant police chief rudy landeros testified , `` in allowing the community the opportunity to obtain driver 's licenses , they will have to pass a driver 's test , and that will make them not only informed drivers , but safer drivers. '' the texas legislature , in a bill by former representative miguel wise , wisely recognized that requiring all drivers to obtain licenses would make texas families safer . had it not been for the veto by texas 's myopic governor , this common-sense call for public safety would be the law in the president 's home state . legal immigrants could also be denied a license . paula waddle , an immigration attorney in the rio grande valley , explained that her clients are having delays of as much as 15 months in getting their legal permanent residency papers because of confusion at the department of homeland security . if these legal immigrants do not have sufficient paperwork to prove their legal status , they will be caught up in this same web of anti-immigrant fervor and denied the opportunity to obtain insurance and drive . ironically , consideration of this bill coincides with the release this week by the u.s. commission on international religious freedom . this proposal would worsen the plight of those whose conditions were the subject of investigation by that commission : asylum-seekers who already face deplorable conditions , who are often treated like common criminals and thrown into jail with common criminals , and who are subject to strip searches as well as solitary confinement . but since current law already bars those who presnet a secruity risk from getting asylum , the additional restrictions in this bill would not make us safer . we must not sacrifice our democracy in a misguided attempt to save it . this bill strikes the wrong balance . anti-immigrant hysteria can not be permitted to drive an agenda that makes us less safe , less healthy , and erodes our civil liberties while failing to address real terrorist threats . the real id bill ought to be really rejected fast by this congress . ",D
"mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of this rule , which will simply allow us to consider general debate , and in 7 minutes we are going to be up in the committee on rules considering a number of those issues that the gentleman from florida just raised , deciding what it is that we will debate here on the house floor tomorrow . so the process is still ongoing and members are involved in that , and it is one that we look forward to considering before too long . i want to congratulate the gentleman from dallas , texas ( mr. sessions ) xz4003670 for his very strong commitment to all homeland security issues , a top priority . and i will say , mr. speaker , that border security is a critically important aspect of the number one priority that we have at the federal level . the five most important words in the middle of the preamble of the u.s. constitution are `` provide for the common defense , '' and securing our borders is a priority , and it should be of any sovereign nation . the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 and i had the privilege of serving as conferees last fall as we sought to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 commission . unfortunately , our friends in the other body decided not to include provisions that would provide guidelines to ensure that the likes of mohammed atta who flew a plane into the world trade center just days before he was to appear in court because of a traffic violation that he had had with a driver 's license , that was something that we felt strongly should have been incorporated to rectify that in the 9/11 commission recommendations . unfortunately , our colleagues in the other body chose to ignore that . the gentleman from california ( mr. ose ) worked hard to ensure that we would be able to complete the 3 1/2 -mile gap through what is known as smugglers gulch , an area that is today devastated environmentally because people cross the border illegally . unfortunately , our colleagues in the other body refused to accept that . both of those things were issues that were of concern to the 9/11 commission ; and if we look at the 9/11 commission report , they make it very clear that we need to address these kinds of issues as they relate to border security . so what we decided , of course , at the end , as we prepare to implement that , was that we would , as soon as the 109th congress convened , proceed with passage of this very important aspect of our border security and , by virtue of that , our national security . that is why i think this measure should enjoy strong bipartisan support . this is an issue that democrats and republicans alike can come together on to ensure that we do , we do , secure our borders . so i think that we have a wonderful opportunity here to deal with border security . the issue of immigration reform is another question . i am supporting this effort on border security in part because i am convinced that we will be able to , down the road and i hope soon , address the immigration reform question . i happen to believe that it is important for us to identify the people who are here in this country illegally . and , yes , i am opposed to granting blanket amnesty , as is president bush , but i do believe that moving in the direction of some sort of worker program is something that we must look at and must address . but we are taking a proper step in finally doing what we wanted to have incorporated in the 9/11 commission package that we passed out of here , and i congratulate all my colleagues who have been involved in this . ",R
"mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of this rule . contrary to what my very good friend from fort lauderdale has said , this is a very fair and balanced rule . if we look at the amendments that were submitted to the committee on rules and those that we have made in order , it is fascinating . we made half of the amendments in order that were proposed by the democrats , those were the priorities established , and 33 percent of the amendments made in order that were submitted by the republicans . we have really turned ourselves inside out to try and accommodate the wide array of issues that were put forward before the committee on rules . yesterday , we had three committees of jurisdiction share an hour and 40 minutes of general debate , and we are going to have an opportunity for free-flowing debate on a wide range of issues today . and i am anxiously looking forward to that . i would like to say that one of the priorities is the passage of the sessions amendment , which is very , very fair and , i believe , an appropriate way to deal with one of the important challenges we face .

"mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i would say to my friend that clearly we are debating this right now , during consideration of the rule . we have had special orders held on this issue . we had a very lengthy hearing in the committee on rules which was available for all of the members ; we had that streamed online . so i think that these issues are pretty darned transparent . we are trying to deal with border security . it is a very important part of the number one priority that we have , and that is our national security . i think in light of that , we are going to have an opportunity to consider these measures , and i want to say that i think we have some amendments that are very , very important that do need to be addressed . we did make in order the amendment by the gentleman from california ( mr. farr ) xz4001290 , my colleague , which calls for steps that would prevent the completion of the 3.5 mile gap in the 14-mile fence that goes along the border from the pacific ocean to the otai mesa in san diego . i have to say that it is amazing , mr. speaker , to observe that it took a shorter period of time to win the second world war than it has to complete this fence . it is a fence wherein actually the provision for it was signed into law by president clinton back in 1997 , and that was done with strong bipartisan support . i worked with my colleagues , the gentleman from california ( mr. hunter ) xz4001910 , and our colleague mr. ose in the last congress , who was very involved in this ; and i just 10 weeks ago flew with t.j. bonner , the president of the national border patrol council , over this gap in the fence . it is very clear that people have taken advantage of it . now , the argument that is going to be used on the fence issue , and we will be bringing that up in just a little while , has to do with the environment . there are people who say that we need to keep all of these environmental constraints in place which have prevented completion of the fence . mr. speaker , what has happened is , we have seen the california coastal commission file a case to prevent completion of it because of something known as the bell 's verio bird . this bird has chosen to nest on part of the fence , and for that reason , they can not complete the fence , and it has allowed people to come in . now , what has happened is , people have illegally fled across the border . we have seen that border in what is known as the tijuana estuary devastated environmentally . there is all kinds of trash in there , and the environmental vote , mr. speaker , is to vote against the farr amendment in favor of completion of the fence . if we were to complete the fence , we would be able to improve the environmental standard at the border . now , this issue is one of the important parts of it , but there is one other issue that i want to mention before i yield back the balance of my time . i introduced legislation , h.r. 100 , to deal with something known as the saint cyr decision , that is included in the manager 's amendment ; and what that does , basically , the provision that we have in the manager 's amendment will finally get to the point where the appellate courts are the courts of jurisdiction , and we will not see consistent appeals . not many people are aware of the fact that , actually , people who are here illegally have an additional appellate step over american citizens . in the manager 's amendment , we will be able to rectify that very , very important issue that does need to be addressed . this is a fair and balanced rule . it will allow us to deal with border security , a very important part of our national security ; and i hope this great day will see us , at the end , pass this very important legislation . ",R
"mr. speaker , let me say , there was a lot of discussion as to whether or not we were going to make the nadler amendment in order , as my friend knows . i know that that addresses the issue of asylum . we are going to have an opportunity for debate on that and an up-or-down vote on that issue . we clearly had to deal with a wide range of questions as we fashioned this rule . i will tell the gentleman that i am very proud of the fact that we were able to incorporate many of the ideas that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle offered . i will tell the gentleman there were 10 amendments submitted by members of the minority , and six of those 10 amendments were , in fact , withdrawn . we made in order two of the four amendments that remained at the committee level . we had on our side 10 amendments that were submitted , and we have only made three of our amendments in order of the original 10 that were submitted . that is why i am arguing that we have , in fact , really gone the extra mile to ensure that the rights of the minority are respected . i appreciate the gentleman yielding . ",R
"mr. speaker , if the gentleman will yield , did i actually say that ? ",R
"mr. chairman , i thank my friend for yielding me this time , and let me just say what it is that got us here . i have listened to the arguments propounded by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle . we are here because , as the chairman of the judiciary said , it has taken longer to complete this fence than it did to win the second world war . the problem that we have is , there needs to be recognition that the environmentally sound vote is to complete this fence . the gentleman from california ( mr. hunter ) xz4001910 held up a poster . if you look at where the fence has been completed , it is pristine , it is clean , it looks great , and it is securing our borders . if you look at that 3 1/2 -mile gap , you see all kinds of trash and devastation and you , of course , exacerbate the pressure with the flow of people coming into this country illegally , creating a wide range of problems . we came this close , when we had strong support , 257 members of this body in the last congress who voted for the ose amendment that should have been included in the 9/11 committee 's recommendation in the conference agreement that we had . the other body prevented us when we were working in the conference to bring it back here . we had indications from democrats and republicans alike that if we brought this measure up we could have strong support of it . it is imperative , it is imperative that we complete this fence . smugglers gulch is an area which is , i believe , posing a very serious threat to our stability in this country and in california . so i urge my colleagues to oppose the farr amendment and cast the environmentally sound vote , which is a `` no '' vote . ",R
"mr. chairman , as someone who for the past 2 years has represented over 40 , 000 soldiers at fort hood , texas , who have fought for our country in iraq , i am deeply appreciative of the expeditious manner in which the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis ) , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 , the gentleman from florida ( chairman young ) , and the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr. murtha ) xz4002860 have worked together to pass this important piece of legislation . this bill sends a very clear message to our troops in harm 's way that while americans may have differences of opinion about the iraqi war , the fact is that we are all unified when it comes to seeing that our troops in harm 's way have all of the support that they need and deserve to do their mission and to come home safely to their families . in the area of responsibility for the subcommittee on which i serve under the committee on appropriations , the military quality of life and veterans affairs , and related agencies subcommittee , i wholeheartedly support the language and funding in this bill . under our subcommittee is $ 3.1 billion in funding , $ 175 million of which goes to the department of defense health care system to deal with the direct increased costs for health care for our wounded troops coming home ; $ 1.5 billion to pay for housing allowance for our guard and reserve soldiers and their families ; and $ 1.3 billion in military construction needed in iraq and afghanistan and throughout our country to support our war against terrorism . i enthusiastically and wholeheartedly support this bill . i do want , mr. chairman , to express one concern . the fact is that as of the end of december of last year , there have been 48 , 000 american troops coming home who have needed health care from the veterans administration health care system . while we put $ 175 million in the dod part of this budget to take care of extra dod health care costs , there is not a dime in this supplemental appropriation bill to help the veterans administration deal with the cost of dealing with 48 , 000 and still counting troops who have needed va health care . using the va secretary 's own testimony before our subcommittee last week , the average cost mathematically is $ 6 , 200 for treatment for each veteran within the va health care system . multiply that number by the 48 , 000 troops coming back from iraq and afghanistan , and we are talking about an additional $ 302 million of cost to the va health care system to help provide needed care for these deserving patriots . i do not think that money ought to come out of the hide of va health care services to other veterans , and i do not think we should cut corners in terms of quality of care for iraqi and afghanistan war veterans once they have left the department of defense system and gone into the va system . in committee we heard some say the va is flush with money . i have looked into that statement , and the fact is that the va is presently laying off hundreds of employees in the va medical system and taking money out of their equipment accounts to fund their personnel accounts . during time of war and in the spirit of this bill supporting our troops not only when they are in the combat zone but when they return home , i think in that spirit we ought to , as this bill goes to conference committee , look specifically at what additional needs the va health care system needs , provide the quality medical care that these troops need . if the war is worth fighting , certainly it is worth paying for and it is worth supporting those troops even after they have left the military and continue to pay the mental and physical price for decades for having stood up for our country . so i would like to urge the committee chairman , the gentleman from california ( mr. lewis ) xz4002391 , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 , the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr. murtha ) xz4002860 , and the gentleman from florida ( mr. young ) xz4004391 to work together with us on a bipartisan basis to see that we can add the needed money for the va health care system , to see that we do not shortchange these great americans who have risked their lives for our country . ",D
"mr. speaker , i rise in support of the bill , although i am disgusted with the anti-immigration provisions in it , particularly the things with the driver 's licenses . mr. speaker , i rise in support of this supplemental appropriations bill , but not without very serious misgivings . i will vote for this legislation because it contains support for our troops in the field and important tsunami relief . with american soldiers in harm 's way , i am very reluctant to vote against funding of military operations . and , having personally seen the devastation in the wake of the tsunami in indonesia , i feel that aid to the victims is critical . nevertheless , i am disgusted by the process by which this legislation came to the floor and by the immigration-related provisions in the bill . this is an appropriations bill . it is not the place to write new immigration law or to include seriously flawed driver 's license provisions . the republicans are clamoring in the senate about the lack of up or down votes on judges and , today , they denied the house not only an up or down vote on the so-called `` real id '' act , but even a real debate on this issue . the immigration sections are seriously flawed . they impose onerous restrictions on foreign nationals in the u.s. , not to mention upon american citizens , and slap a massive unfunded mandate upon the states . shortly after this legislation takes effect , i can only imagine that , instead of more licensed drivers on the roads , there will be less . instead of safer roads , we will have more reckless drivers operating completely outside of our laws . america is a nation of immigrants and our strength is in our diversity . we are founded upon the people who have come from all corners of the globe and are continually enriched by the unique strengths that they add to our national mosaic . we must not undermine the careful balance our nation has struck . i , therefore , strongly oppose these id and immigration-related sections and pledge to fight hard in the future to remove the offensive provisions from the law . in the end , as a legislator , i must vote on the bill in front of me , and in this instance i must vote for the vital funding contained in this bill . but , mr. speaker , please know that i will work hard in the day ahead to strike the dangerously flawed sections from the code . ",D
"mr. chairman , i rise today in opposition to h.r. 418 . although i support the goals of this legislation , h.r. 418 unfortunately contains too many misguided provisions . last year , i voted to pass the 9/11 commission 's bipartisan recommendations to reform identification standards and beef up security on our nation 's border . this legislation would repeal that new law before it has a chance to work . had the provisions of h.r. 418 been in place prior to september 11 , 2001 , they would not have stopped a single one of the 19 terrorists . h.r. 418 would force virtually every adult in the united states to go to the dmv to get a new driver 's license , and with 14 , 000 local jurisdictions in this country currently issuing identification , it would be impossible to impose a single standard within in the three-year limit in the bill . i will also vote to remove provisions ",D
"mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . i have been watching this debate all morning , and i am really concerned about what is happening here on the floor of the house of representatives . i have never heard so much misstatement of fact about a piece of legislation that is very important . the problem is , this legislation never had a hearing in committee , never had public review . we have never looked at the language ; i doubt that any members have read the bill in its entirety . that is not what this house is all about , because this law is a very , very serious law , and it is going to affect people 's lives . i have heard statements here on the floor that the recommendations in this bill are in the 9/11 commission . let me give an example . section 102 , which deals with the border fence , the commission never even mentioned the border fence . why ? because it is not a problem . we have been building it . what we have run into is a couple of environmental snags . so what does this bill do ? it says okay , waive all that . waive the law . this is a precedent that has never been done before in the united states congress . waive all laws , whether those laws pertain to indian burial grounds , whether they are labor laws , discrimination laws , small business laws , environmental laws . we will just waive them . and guess what , no court , as it says , `` no court shall have jurisdiction. '' what kind of a measure is this ? do we just run into problems and we come to the floor of congress and say , just get rid of the law ? here is a country that celebrated the tearing down of the berlin wall , a country that celebrated the elections in iraq so people will have the rule of law ; and then when we have the rule of law , we just waive it . there was no request from the state of california for this bill . mexico , our biggest trade partner , nothing like this ; and what we are saying to the world is , do not worry , we are just going to cram through everything and forget the law . this is wrong , and i am going to have an amendment on the floor tomorrow to repeal it . i hope everyone votes for it . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . this amendment is simple and straightforward . it strikes section 102 , which is entitled the `` waiver of laws necessary for the improvement of barriers and borders '' from the bill . i think the provision is trying to fix a process that is not broken . i offer this amendment to strike section 102 , not to stop construction of the remaining 3 miles of the border fence , but to preserve the rule of law that this country was founded on . i want my colleagues to listen . i want to make this very clear . the breadth of this provision is unprecedented . the border fence in san diego is under construction right now . of the 14 miles authorized to be constructed , more than 9 miles of triple fence have been completed . only two sections have not been finished . in order to finish the fence , the customs and border patrol has proposed to fill a canyon known as smugglers gulch with over 2 million cubic yards of dirt . the triple fence would then be extended across the filled gulch . in february 2004 , the coastal commission of california determined that the customs and border patrol had not demonstrated , among other things , that the project was consistent to `` maximize '' to the extent practicable with the policies of the california coastal management program , the state program approved under the federal coastal zone management act . the coastal zone management act requires federal agency activity within and outside the coastal zone that affects any land use , water or other natural resources in the coastal zone to be carried out in a manner that is consistent , to the maximum extent practicable , with the policies of an approved state management program . however , as stringent as these requirements are , if a federal court finds a federal activity to be inconsistent with an improved state program , the secretary determines that the compliance is unlikely to be achieved through mediation , the president may exempt from compliance the activity if the president determines that the activity is in the paramount interest of the united states . all the authority needed to build the barrier fence already exists in law . we can use laws and process that we have to get this fence built . there is no need for a blanket waiver to get any barrier constructed . on october 26 of 2004 the coastal commission staff met with the customs and border patrol/homeland security . in that meeting the customs and border patrol explained why they did not believe additional comments , other than those that had already been agreed upon , were necessary to bring the project into compliance with the applicable coastal policies . customs and border patrol maintained that it still wanted to continue to work with the coastal commission on measures they had agreed to , and the coastal commission indicated their continued willingness to work with them , despite the overall disagreement with some of the project components such as the smugglers gulch fill . coastal commission informed customs that in order to complete the federal consistency review process , they would have to write a letter outlining their position . however , the coastal commission has not received any letter . so why are we trying to fix something that is working through the established process of law ? i ask because the reach of this amendment is actually the border fence in san diego . the proposed section 102 gives an unprecedented waiver and power to the secretary of homeland security , not only for the border fence in san diego but for any , any area . if enacted , the new 102 section would provide the secretary of homeland security not only with the authority to waive all laws he determines necessary to ensure the expeditious construction of barriers and roads , but the requirement that the secretary do so . as i mentioned , there is no evidence that such an extraordinary rejection of the rule of law is necessary in the first instance . current law allows the dhs secretary to waive the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act at the barrier , and this same provision was allowed to the attorney general prior to the creation of the department of homeland security . this provision has never , to date , been used in san diego nor am i aware at any other time the authority has been used on the barrier fence . so the remedies are there ; they are in the law . we forget in this debate that mexico is the number one trading partner of california . it is the busiest border in the world for the legitimate transfer of people and commerce , and it is in the city and county of san diego , and neither of those jurisdictions has asked for this draconian waiver . neither has the state of california . why would the government of the united states of america , at a time when we are advocating the support and enforcement of law , why would the government now want to forbid the use of our own law to finish the fence ? not even the importance of securing the border can justify placing a government official above the law . as i mentioned , my colleagues ought to be wary of what is proposed here . it grants authority to waive all laws notwithstanding any other provision of the law . this section also says , notwithstanding any other provision of the law , no court shall have jurisdiction to hear a claim , to order any relief . how can we celebrate elections in iraq and the honor of law when we in congress are now asking that we waive all laws ? mr. chairman , i rise today in strong opposition to h.r. 418 and i urge my colleagues to do the same . this bill is a misguided attempt to implement immigration reform under the guise of homeland security . this bill turns its back on a core principle that distinguishes america from other nations ; that of being a safe haven for the tired , poor , and weak . the three specific policies that the bill addresses -- the border fence , asylum provisions and driver 's licenses standards -- should have been vetted through the committee process . instead , this legislation has been rushed through the process -- without hearings , without debate , and with very little input from the minority side of the aisle . this bill is being debated simply for politics instead of going through a legitimate legislative process , a fact that should be of concern to every member , republican and democrat alike . today i will offer an amendment . my amendment is simple and straight forward . it strikes section 102 from the `` real id act of 2005 '' . the proposed provision is trying to fix a process that is n't broken . section 102 gives an unprecedented waiver and power to the secretary of homeland security . if passed , the secretary has the sole discretion to wave all laws in order to expedite the construction of barriers and roads . there is no evidence that such an extraordinary rejection of the rule of law is necessary in the first instance . current law already allows the dhs secretary to waive the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act for the fence construction , the same exemption authorization that was allowed the attorney general prior to creation of dhs . i look forward to the debate on my amendment . as i stated before , h.r. 418 is not a good bill and even more troubling is that we had no hearings or committee debate on it . we need frank and productive dialogue about the state of our immigration system and this bill does nothing to open up the discussion that this country needs to have . i do not support illegal immigration , but i do support the people who have come to our country and played by the rules in order to obtain their citizenship status . not only do we have a responsibility and a proud history of protecting those who seek asylum in our country , which this bill is trying to thwart , we have a responsibility to legal immigrants who are contributing to our society to reduce the lengthy backlog to citizenship . just earlier this week in meeting with some bureau of citizenship and immigration services employees , i was not surprised to learn that workers who were hired to help eliminate the backlog four years ago have been asked to stay on for another year . i do not often hear of temporary employees that are necessary for five years . i also the effects of the real id act are not only bad for domestic politics , they are destructive for the peace process in the middle east . the act states : `` an alien who is an officer , official , representative , or spokesman of the palestine liberation organization is considered , for purposes of this act , to be engaged in a terrorist activity. '' in the first place , the united states already has a formal , congressionally approved mechanism for designating foreign terrorist organizations and imposing sanctions on them . the plo is not on the u.s. list of foreign terrorist organizations . this sneaky , backdoor attempt to override the responsibility of the state department and the will of congress is an incredibly stupid way to execute u.s. diplomacy . second , we are now on the cusp of a historic moment in the middle east peace process . the administration has promised that they will be actively engaged in the middle east peace process . i find it hard to believe that they can be `` actively '' engaged in the peace process if the president will not be able to invite newly elected president mahmoud abbas to his texas ranch , camp david or any other location within the united states . president abbas appears to be making considerable efforts in brokering peace , and the united states should be supporting his efforts . the effects of this provision will be a diplomatic nightmare and damage the united states 's ability to be a fair broker in the peace process . this provision is an embarrassment to united states diplomacy -- it is highly counterproductive to peace negotiations . furthermore , i have concerns with the national driver 's license standards in this bill . current law already addresses this issue , but the regulations have been implemented since this bill was passed only 10 weeks ago . national driver 's license standards in this bill create an unfunded mandate for states . under this bill , at least 10 states would be forced to make significant changes to their systems , despite the fact that security standards can be attained without the interference this bill creates . state control of the licensing and identification process is crucial to maintaining public safety , bolstering security , reducing fraud , keeping costs of car insurance down and protecting privacy and federal standards for such documents should be limited to those enumerated in the intelligence reform act of 2004 . additionally , the proponents of this bill do not want you to know that h.r. 418 would not have prevented 9/11 hijackers from obtaining a driver 's license or id . the breach of our security was a result of the hijackers having been issued legal visas to come to the united states , which many of them used to apply for driver 's licenses and identification cards . does h.r. 418 seek to address the root of the problem here ? no , obviously not . again , this bill is political posturing under the guise of national security . instead of debating h.r. 418 , the house of representatives should be focused on ensuring the successful enactment of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 and working on comprehensively reforming our immigration system so that immigration is legal , safe , orderly , and reflective of the needs of american families , businesses , and national security . leadership should be ashamed to have brought a bill like this that will affect our environment , our citizens , and people from all around the world to the floor in such a manner . i can not support the process nor the actual policy this bill proposes and i urge my colleagues vote no on h.r. 418 .

"mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . we have heard a lot of talk here today , and i submit that this is not the answer , to emasculate all the laws . i would bet that if the gentleman from california ( mr. hunter ) xz4001910 , the gentleman from california ( mr. cunningham ) xz4000910 , myself and any other interested party sat down , one meeting with all the interested parties , we could resolve this . but that is not the way they want to proceed . this was not a recommendation of the 9/11 commission . this is essentially emasculating all laws to get an environmental project completed . and emasculating all laws is not the way to do it . this amendment is a good amendment because it does not allow my colleagues to emasculate all laws . what it allows us to do is to let this process work . and with the pressure that has been brought here today , we can get that fence built . the opposition on this side is not against the fence , it is against emasculating all the laws of the land in order to get there . so i ask for an `` aye '' vote . mr. chairman , i submit for the record a memorandum of the congressional research service , dated february 7 , 2005 , regarding the real id act . congressional research service , february 7 , 2005 . memorandum & lt ; br & gt ; to : house committee on homeland security , attention : sue ramanathan ; and house committee on the judiciary , attention : kristin wells . pursuant to your request on february 3 , this memorandum analyzes section 102 of h.r. 418 , the real id act . section 102 , captioned `` waiver of laws necessary for improvement of barriers at borders , '' provides the secretary of homeland security with authority to waive all laws he deems necessary for the expeditious construction of the barriers authorized to be constructed by 102 of the illegal immigration reform and immigration responsibility act of 1996 ( iirira ) ( p.l . 104-208 , div . c , codified at 8 u.s.c . 1103 note ) and removes judicial review from such waiver decisions . specifically , this memorandum discusses the extent to which congress has passed laws that provide waivers comparable to 102 of h.r. 418 and outlines some of the legal issues that could potentially arise if 102 h.r. 418 , 102 section 102 of h.r. 418 would amend 102 ( c ) of iirira to read as follows : ( c ) waiver. -- ( 1 ) in general. -- notwithstanding any other provision of law , the secretary of homeland security shall have the authority to waive , and shall waive , all laws such secretary , in such secretary 's sole discretion , determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this section . ( 2 ) no judicial review. -- notwithstanding any other provision of law ( statutory or nonstatutory ) , no court shall have jurisdiction -- ( a ) to hear any cause or claim arising from any action undertaken , or any decision made , by the secretary of homeland security pursuant to paragraph ( 1 ) ; or ( b ) to order compensatory , declaratory , injunctive , equitable , or any other relief for damage alleged to arise from any such action or decision . waiver provisions if enacted , the new 102 would provide the secretary of homeland security with not only the authority to waive all laws he determines necessary to ensure the expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under 102 of iirira , but the requirement that the secretary do so . this provision could provide the secretary with broader waiver authority than what is currently in 102 ( c ) of iirira . this authority would apparently include laws other than the endangered species act and the national environmental policy act , but may not include a waiver of protections established in the constitution . all laws waived , however , must be determined by the secretary to be necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads . the waiver authority congress commonly waives preexisting laws , though the process necessary to complete the waiver and the number of laws waived vary considerably from provision to provision . even more common is the use of the phrase , `` notwithstanding any other provision of law. '' while the use of a broad `` notwithstanding any other provision of law '' infrequently governs interpretation , such directives seem facially preclusive , and some courts have determined that `` notwithstanding '' language may serve to explicitly preempt the application of other laws . other courts , however , have held that such provisions are generally not dispositive in determining the preemptive effect of a statute . after a review of federal law , primarily through electronic database searches and consultations with various crs experts , we were unable to locate a waiver provision identical to that of 102 of h.r. 418 -- i.e. , a provision that contains `` notwithstanding language , '' provides a secretary of an executive agency the authority to waive all laws such secretary determines necessary , and directs the secretary to waive such laws . much more common , it appears , are waiver provisions that ( 1 ) exempt an action from other requirements contained in the act that authorizes the action , ( 2 ) specifically delineate the laws to be waived , or ( 3 ) waive a grouping of similar laws . the most analogous provisions that we located appear to be , at least on their face , the following : 43 u.s.c . 1652 ( c ) : allows the secretary of the interior and other federal officers and agencies the authority to waive any procedural requirements of law or regulation which they deem desirable for authorizations that are necessary for or related to the construction , operation , and maintenance of the trans-alaska oil pipeline system ( e.g. , rights-of-way , permits , and leases ) . 25 u.s.c . 3406 : allows the secretaries of the interior , labor , health and human services , and education , notwithstanding any other law , to waive any statutory requirement , regulation , policy , or procedure promulgated by their agency that is identified by a tribal government as necessary to implement a submitted tribal plan under the indian employment , training and related services demonstration act of 1992 , as amended . 20 u.s.c . 7426 : provides almost identical waiver language to that of 25 u.s.c . 3406 , but for plans submitted by tribal governments for the integration of education and related services provided to indian students . there are many other provisions that arguably grant broad waiver authority similar to that of 102 , but contain qualifications or reporting requirements that seem to limit their breadth . for example , 43 u.s.c . 2008 allows the president to waive provisions of federal law he deems necessary in the national interest to facilitate the construction or operation of crude oil transportation systems , but such waivers must be submitted to congress , and congress must pass a joint resolution before the president can act on the waivers . as mentioned above and as the examples we have set forth arguably demonstrate , the breadth of waiver authority granted by 102 of h.r. 418 does not appear to be common in the federal law searched . judicial review provisions by including the language `` no court , '' 102 ( c ) ( 2 ) of h.r. 418 appears to preclude judicial review of a secretary 's decision to waive provisions of law by both federal and state courts . the preclusion of judicial review in state court and of state claims appears buttressed by the fact that 102 ( c ) is explicitly intended to preclude judicial review of nonstatutory laws -- a term which would seem to imply the inclusion of state constitutional and common law claims . it is generally accepted that article iii of the united states constitution grants congress the authority to regulate the jurisdiction , procedures , and remedies available in federal courts . however , what remains uncertain is whether congress 's authority , pursuant to article iii , extends to with respect to congress 's ability to control the jurisdiction of state courts , the supreme court has ruled that subject to a congressional provision to the contrary , state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all the classes of cases and controversies enumerated in article iii , except for suits between states , suits in which either the united states or a foreign state is a party , and those considered within the traditional jurisdiction of admiralty law . thus , it appears possible to argue that congress has a plenary power to allocate jurisdiction between the state and federal courts . in other words , if , for example , congress can make jurisdiction over an area of law exclusively federal , thereby depriving state courts of any ability to hear the claim , it appears that congress may also be able to remove a cause of action from state courts without concurrently granting jurisdiction to the federal courts . state courts , however , are often considered to be independent and autonomous from the federal court system . this independent status has led some scholars to argue that because the constitution appears to reserve to the states the authority to control the jurisdiction of their own courts , congress 's `` only means of allocating jurisdiction is through control of the federal court 's jurisdiction. '' the argument that state courts are autonomous can be derived , in part , from the supreme court 's doctrine with respect to its ability to review decisions from turning to congress 's ability to remove jurisdiction with respect to claims arising under the constitution , it appears that supreme court precedent requires that at least some forum be provided for the redress of constitutional rights . while it appears that the supreme court has not directly addressed whether there needs to be a judicial forum to vindicate all constitutional rights , it appears that the court has taken to noting constitutional reservations about legislative denials for jurisdiction for judicial review of constitutional issues , as well as construction of statutes that purport to limit the court 's jurisdiction . at least one justice , however , has indicated that there have been particular cases , such as political question cases , where all constitutional review is in effect precluded . nevertheless , the court has generally found a requirement that effective judicial remedies be present . for example , in cases involving particular rights , such as the availability of effective remedies for fifth amendment takings , the court has held that `` the compensation remedy is required by the constitution. '' in addition , lower federal courts appear to have held that , in most cases , some forum must be provided for the vindication of constitutional rights . cases such as these would seem to provide a basis for the court to find that parties seeking to vindicate other particular rights must have a judicial forum for such challenges ; therefore , the court may construe the provisions of h.r. 418 in a manner that preserves this right .

"mr. chairman , i demand a recorded vote . ",D
"mr. speaker , i rise today in opposition to the emergency supplemental appropriations ( hr 1268 ) , on substance and process . i am strongly supportive of our fighting men and women , and mourn the loss of nearly 1 , 600 americans who have died in iraq , four of whom resided in my congressional district . on substance , this bill fails to provide an exit strategy for our troops in iraq . since iraq held democratic elections in january , the us should have been implementing an aggressive exit strategy that includes a timetable for the training of iraqi security forces , so us troops can return home . moreover , with nearly $ 10 billion already appropriated but not spent for critical reconstruction projects in iraq , like rebuilding electrical grids and establishing telecommunications networks , us policy objectives for iraqi independence are jeopardized . on process , many of the items in this bill should be funded under the regular order in the annual appropriations cycle . unfortunately , the republican leadership has used this bill as a vehicle for passage of immigration measures that are divisive and harmful for our country , and could n't be passed as stand-alone bills . provisions commonly known as the `` real id act '' regarding national driver 's license standards , asylum law and completion of a southern border fence have been controversial from day one , but were added to appease a vocal minority of anti-immigrant advocates . i and many others in congress would like to have a rational debate on immigration reform , but we are denied the opportunity when the leadership attaches non-germane immigration measures to a funding bill . to better demonstrate how the process has been hijacked by a minority of the majority , many of the same provisions that constitute the real id provisions in the supplemental being considered today were stripped from the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act ( pl 108-458 ) in conference because of their extreme nature . one of the most egregious provisions in the real id section of the supplemental is the blanket authority given to the secretary of homeland security to expedite construction of the remaining three miles of the southern border fence in san diego . all americans should be concerned that the dhs secretary has carte blanche authority to waive any and all laws in the name of border security . this provision is a dangerous attack against the civil rights of all americans , when any law can be waived under the guise of border security . blanket authority to complete the three mile border fence is especially `` in your face '' politics when , under current law , the dhs secretary already has a national security waiver for the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act . we must work harder to strike a balance between our national security and environmental protection , not simply ignore environmental laws . furthermore , the driver 's license provisions of this bill touted in the name of national security are equally concerning . it is indeed ironic that these provisions would not have stopped the 9/11 hijackers from obtaining driver 's licenses . the breach of our border security was a result of the hijackers having been issued legal visas to enter the us , which many of them used to apply for driver 's licenses and identification cards . even if the real id provisions had been in place before the 9/11 attacks , the hijackers still would have been able to obtain a driver 's license or state-issued id . again , a minority of the majority is playing on the fears of this nation to enact a flawed policy that does not actually address the problem it purports to fix . for the record , i do not support illegal immigration , but i do support a regulated process for immigrants who enter the us legally , pay their taxes and play by the rules to earn us citizenship . no one can deny that comprehensive immigration reform is a topic on the minds of our constituents -- but such a critical policy debate should be conducted on its own merits .

"mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 and all of those on the republican side who are so concerned about my district . i represent the california border between mexico and the united states . this so-called fence that you want to put in my district is really a giant public works project that does enormous harm . i wish you were equally concerned about the 50 million gallons of sewage that flows into my district that we should be treating . i wish you were concerned about the legal border crossings , that take four or five hours some days . i wish you would be concerned about my local health facilities who treat the undocumented and refund those dollars . but , no , you want to put a public works project in that waives all existing environmental laws necessary to ensure the construction of roads , barriers , cut and fills , taking down mountains . this would result in an enormous waste of millions of federal and state dollars that have already been contributed to restore and protect this area in san diego , its historical , its cultural , its environmental resources . ironically , the united nations ramsar convention recently bestowed the prestigious label of `` wetlands of international importance '' on this 2 , 500-acre national wildlife refuge and state park that you are going to destroy . now , we know we have to have border security . we live right there . you think we want to be overrun with terrorists ? we know what it takes . we know what a smart border is . and what you are suggesting is not a smart border . for a minimal security benefit and maximum dollars spent , you will do irreparable damage to areas along the western portion of the u.s.-mexico border . this multitiered fence , road building , cut and fill , shaving down of mountains will destroy , as i said , an environmentally sensitive area , violate several sections of the coastal act and destroy acres of sensitive habitat and wetlands and coastline . this sensitive habitat plays a vital role in the sustainability of the binational ecosystem . vote down this bill .

"mr. chairman , i offer an amendment . the clerk read as follows : amendment offered by mr. filner : at the end of title v ( page 69 , after line 17 ) , insert the following new section : sec . __ . in addition to amounts otherwise appropriated in this act , there is hereby appropriated for fiscal year 2005 , for `` department of veterans affairs -- veterans health administration -- medical services '' , $ 3 , 100 , 000 , 000 : provided , that the amounts provided under this section are designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 402 of the conference report to accompany s. con . res. 95 ( 108th congress ) . ",D
"mr. chairman , i have an amendment which i am labeling an emergency amendment . it is an emergency amendment because the money is needed for the veterans of this nation , especially those who are returning from the war in iraq and afghanistan who may not be able to get the services they need for a variety of wounds , both physical and mental . let me first say where i got the number of $ 3.1 billion . it is not just a figure grabbed from the air . every year the veterans service organizations of this nation put together a budget called the independent budget for the department of veterans affairs . this is the one for 2006 . what it says is that just to keep meeting the needs for our current veterans and those who we expect to see in the coming year , we will need an additional $ 3.1 billion than was allocated by the president in his budget . we do not know what this house will adopt yet , so this figure is drawn from the inadequacies of the president 's budget as he gave it to congress recently . this is a supplemental budget for those fighting in iraq and afghanistan . at least that is the title . let me make sure all the people of the house understand the relevance of the veterans budget for the war that we are fighting abroad . here is what our first president , george washington , said and it has never been done more eloquently : `` the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war , no matter how justified , shall be directly proportional as to how they perceive the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country. '' mr. chairman , the morale of our troops overseas depends on how we are going to treat their comrades when they return and how we treat their comrades who served in earlier battles . we are not treating them to the level that is worthy of their sacrifice . whether you look at the amount of nurses , whether you look at research funds , whether you look at the resources for post-traumatic stress disorder for which virtually every returning soldier , marine who is in iraq and afghanistan may have , wherever you look , there is a deficiency in this veterans budget . i call that an emergency . i call that important to the struggle that is being waged overseas . if you are voting for that struggle , you have to vote to make sure the veterans who come back from that struggle are well treated . right now we have a proposal from the president which advocates a mere one-half of 1 percent increase in the veterans health care budget over the previous year . that is a real cut , because of health inflation and the advancing age and the needs of the population , to about a 14 or 15 percent cut by the administration 's own figures . so we are cutting in real terms 15 percent from the veterans health care budget . how does the administration want to fund that cut ? doubling the copayments for prescription drugs , adding an enrollment fee of up to $ 250 for those in the so-called lower categories of veterans preference . that is outrageous . that is unconscionable to charge the veterans of this nation for their own health care and to balance the budget on the backs of these veterans . the chairman of the committee on veterans ' affairs was not satisfied with having a $ 250 enrollment fee . he proposed doubling it to almost $ 500 for some of these veterans . these veterans are supposedly in lower categories , either because of the nature of their illness or their income . but , madam chairman , this nation , this congress has the funds to help all of these veterans to get the care that they need . let me remind my colleagues , this is a $ 2.5 trillion budget that we are operating within our nation . we have about a $ 400 billion deficit , a $ 7.5 trillion debt . we are spending several billion dollars a week in iraq . yet someone is going to say that we do not have the $ 3 billion that is necessary for our veterans ? i reject that argument because this is a nation that is worthy of its veterans . this a nation that could put the money where it is needed . and this is a nation that can do what is required for our veterans . we simply can not charge these copayments . we simply can not charge this enrollment fee . we simply can not continue to have a va that is gagged from informing veterans of their rights under law . that is what is happening in the va today . my amendment to provide $ 3 billion extra will correct that injustice . ",D
"madam chairman , i know how reluctant the chairman is . this is a supplemental budget . by definition it goes beyond whatever we did in the previous year . that is why it is called a supplemental . and by some technical mumbo jumbo , he has managed to say that this supplemental is not subject to the rule that he just read . through technicalities , through arcane kinds of things , he is saying that the veterans of this nation are not entitled to this care because he is using a rule which is not being used for the $ 81 billion that we have on the floor but is used for this $ 3 billion that we are trying to use for our nation 's veterans . madam chairman , i understand these rules , and i understand these technical points of order . they are designed to protect certain amendments and not have others . fine . but when one uses that rule to shut out the veterans of this nation , to shut out the troops that are coming back from iraq and afghanistan , from the care that they deserve and will need , we are going to shut down ptsd programs , madam chairman , all across this nation , and yet every soldier and marine is going to come back with potentially that disorder . so one can use all the rules , but what we are doing here is immoral , it is unconscionable , it is outrageous that we would be treating the veterans in this way . ",D
"madam chairman , i understand what the chairman is saying . i have been around here long enough . i do not have confidence in that regular order . i know what is going to happen then . then we will be accused of legislating on appropriations or some other rule will be brought up . so i do not accept the ruling . i intend to challenge the ruling , and i think we owe this to our veterans . ",D
"mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding . i want to thank the gentleman from texas ( mr. reyes ) xz4003370 for bringing us these two amendments . again , these are for national security emergency issues , border patrol agents at our border . i represent all the california-mexico border . i know that we need these agents . the president asked for them , and yet he did not put the money in to pay for them . in addition , every veterans group and the va itself say to complete the year , giving the services they need , they need another $ 1.3 billion . this is truly an emergency . the rules that will be used once again to say that our national defense at the border , our veterans to get their adequate health care , somehow we violate the rules , but let us not violate common sense . common sense says we need these funds . we need this protection . we need these services for our veterans . let us dispense with the technical objections and fund what we need for our veterans and for our border defense . ",D
"mr. speaker , let me reiterate what i said about nitpicking and arcane rules . this whole bill is a violation of the rules of the house except for the fact that it says in the bill it does not violate the rules . so telling us that we should have respect for the rules , my colleagues ought to show some respect for the good sense of the american people , for common sense . this whole bill is a violation of the rules without a waiver . is that not true , mr. chairman ? would this bill be a violation of the rules if there was not a waiver involved in the rules ? as i said , the rules are being used to damage common sense and to damage our nation 's security and damage our health care to our veterans . i think it is a disgrace to use those rules for these purposes . ",D
"mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment be read . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . mr. chairman , i call this the `` let u.s. veterans rebuild iraq and afghanistan '' amendment . once again , i rise in support of the veterans of our nation . we have a major , major , major operation in iraq and afghanistan . the bill on the floor today appropriates a sum of $ 81 billion , and we will be spending over $ 200 billion . it seems to me that we ought to guarantee jobs to veterans with companies that are awarded government contracts from this fund . our active duty are fighting , but those who volunteer to go and help in other ways should have the preference that their veterans ' service offers . we have all rallied to support our troops , but often after they come home , our veterans are not treated with the respect they deserve . i outlined yesterday the lack of respect that they will have and continue to have because of lack of adequate funding in the health care system . ptsd , post-traumatic stress disorder , for example , will not have the funding that is needed to treat what is expected to arise out of the current war . as i said yesterday , research funds are being cut , nurses ' positions are being cut . i tried yesterday to put an amendment on the floor that would supplement this supplemental with an additional $ 3 billion that the veterans groups think and have testified and have outlined is necessary . that $ 3 billion was not added in yesterday 's supplemental . so today i ask that we ensure that there are jobs for our nation 's veterans , whether they are new or old . let us give them the preference that they have in law at home with the preference for the contracts that are being awarded with such abandon in the middle east today . we know , if we do not serve our veterans with jobs or health care , what occurs . we know that up to half of the homeless on the streets today are veterans , mainly from vietnam , because we did not give them the honor , the respect , the health care , the jobs , the housing that they needed . and so they are on the street after having fought for this country . one way to make sure that this does not happen to anyone else is to include veterans in the rebuilding of iraq and afghanistan . many of them fought for freedom for those nations . let us get them involved in the effort to build the future . mr. chairman , i hope that the rules are not invoked here once again to stop a commonsense approach to helping our veterans in this nation . mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .

"once again we are using the rules to block a commonsense amendment . it seems to me that the chairman has deeper issues than a blocking of the thing on a procedural ground and feels that the va is not doing its job . that is obviously a deep issue that we ought to discuss , but that should not lead him to block this amendment . in addition , the only way i could judge the sincerity of the majority party in these issues is to see what they had done to the chairman of the committee i have sat on for the last 12 years ; that is , the va committee . the chairman was removed from that job , purged from that job because he stood up for veterans . i hope , mr. chairman , that the gentleman will join me on a mission as i join him on a mission for accountability and efficiency to convince the leadership of his party to put back on that committee members of the committee who actually fight for veterans . once again , i think the veterans of this nation ought to understand that the rules of this house can be waived for anything that the majority party wants , but when it comes to the veterans of this nation , they refuse to waive the rules . ",D
"mr. chairman , i thank my colleague for yielding me this time . and i appreciate his bringing this amendment to the floor , and i support it . it is absolutely critical that we secure our borders . those of us who live in arizona know that our borders are simply not secure . arizona has become a doormat for illegal aliens . there are thousands and thousands that are apprehended every week and thousands more who are not apprehended . they slip through . the cost to arizona is considerable . now , i happen to believe , along with my colleague , that we need comprehensive immigration reform that has to be part of our long-term plan . but in the interim , we certainly need to do some things , and this amendment goes a long way toward doing them . we need vulnerability and threat assessments . dhs needs to see what kind of technology , what kind of personnel and equipment is going to be needed . all of us have viewed over the past couple of years the new technologies in land surveillance , surface surveillance , and they are promising . they are things that can be done that are not being done . we need a good assessment and recommendations made for us to follow through on . we have aerial work that is being done ; not enough , more surveillance is needed there . also , this amendment calls for increased communications , better communications between those on the ground and those of us here as policymakers and those who implement the policy . we simply need better information to be able to have recommendations that we can follow up on . we have , obviously , limited resources at our disposal . we need to make sure that they are employed in the best way possible , and this amendment will go a long way toward ensuring that . again , i commend the gentleman from arizona for bringing this forward , and the chairman for insisting that this bill be brought forward . ",R
"mr. chairman , i rise today in support of the real id act , and i thank the chairman for his courage and hard work on this vital measure . over a decade ago , the ability of ramzi yousef , the mastermind behind the 1993 world trade center bombing to be granted asylum and to move freely in the country should have signaled that something was terribly wrong with our system . it did not , and 8 years later , 19 terrorists collectively carrying a total of 63 valid u.s. driver 's licenses , boarded planes to finish yousef 's work . it is now over 3 years since that tragic september 11th . today , we are considering a vital piece of legislation to address three key failures of current security policy . first , the real id act mandates standards to obtain driver 's licenses ; second , it tightens our nation 's asylum laws , which easily allow suspected terrorists into our nation ; and finally , it addresses the need to secure our borders . these concepts are not rocket science . the need for these reforms has been reiterated over and over , and in expert testimony , in anecdotal evidence from security professionals , in scholarly research and in evidence presented from our nation 's justice and military personnel . but the fact of the matter is , the most compelling reason to pass this bill is just plain old common sense . we can not repeat enough what the 9/11 commission said : `` for terrorists , travel documents are as important as weapons. '' they are right . they also said , `` it is elemental to border security to know who is coming into the country. '' today , more than 9 million people have entered the united states outside the legal immigration system . the security chain protecting america is only as good as its weakest link . it does not take a congressman or a national security expert to tell you this . most americans know that despite the rhetoric we hear against this bill , as long as we ignore the need for border security , we place them and their families at risk . i strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the real id act . ",R
"mr. speaker , first we have to talk about the procedure . this is a complicated bill . it includes several different subjects , asylum , identification , a fence , yet apparently the majority is contemplating , at most , one amendment . this is legislation by hostage-taking . you put a whole bunch of things together , including several that are controversial , so if members oppose any one of them , they will be extorted into voting for the whole package . we are in the process now , after the election in iraq , of trying to persuade the shiia , who will be in the overwhelming majority , to practice democracy , not to abuse their majority , but in fact to encourage members of the minority to participate . it is essential for us to be able to salvage what is going on in iraq for there to be an agreement on the part of the sunni muslims to participate . in other words , we are telling the people of iraq that to practice democracy means respect for minority rights . and here we have the majority in the house of representatives , a fairly narrow majority , apparently contemplating forcing an up-or-down vote on controversial legislation , maybe allowing one amendment , clearly repressing the strong desire of the minority to be able fully to debate it . in the end , the majority will decide , but they do n't even want the debate . and i guess i know , mr. speaker , it is a violation to address the tv audience , and i will not do so . but i will express the hope that if there are any members of the iraqi provisional assembly watching this , they understand the message that is very important . please do not try this at home . do not , in the iraqi assembly , show disrespect for the rights of the minority . that is the hallmark of this outrageous procedure . and why are we doing it ? it is 1 : 35 on wednesday . we are going to finish this debate , general debate and have the rest of the day to do nothing , tomorrow then maybe debate one or two amendments . there is no reason why . you know what ? what about an open rule ? what about democracy ? what about bringing a complicated bill to the floor and letting members offer amendments and the majority will win . you are not afraid , apparently , of losing the vote . you are afraid of losing the argument . and i understand why . let me talk now about asylum . this congress created the united states commission on international religious freedom in 1998 . that commission just issued a very lengthy report , very critical of the inhumane aspects of our asylum operation . mr. speaker , i include for the record the article from the new york times , documenting that report at this point . asylum seekers treated poorly , u.s. panel says thousands of people who come to the united states saying they are seeking refuge from persecution are treated like criminals while their claims are evaluated -- strip-searched , shackled and often thrown into solitary confinement in local jails and federal detention centers -- a bipartisan federal commission found in a report to be released today . the report , by the united states commission on international religious freedom , an agency created by congress in 1998 , describes an ad hoc system run by the department of homeland security that has extreme disparities in who is released or granted asylum , depending on whether someone seeks refuge in texas or new york , comes from iraq or haiti , or is represented by a lawyer . the new york metropolitan region ranks among the harshest in terms of the conditions of detention centers , with constant surveillance , stark quarters and degrading treatment . those awaiting a court decision on asylum are also less likely to be freed . for example , 3.8 percent of asylum seekers were freed from the detention center in elizabeth , n.j. , compared with 94 percent in san antonio . there were 8.4 percent released from the detention center in queens , while in chicago 81 percent were let go . one of the experts who examined the centers for the commission , craig haney , a psychologist who briefed the senate judiciary committee on the subject yesterday , said he was shocked by what he found . `` i was taken aback by the severity of conditions , the severity of deprivations and , frankly , the expense , '' he said in an interview . he said that one of 19 centers examined handled asylum seekers differently from criminals -- in broward county , fla. , where many seeking refuge are from cuba and where former cuban refugees form a potent political force . at $ 83 a day , the florida center costs less than half the $ 200 per detainee of the queens detention center , though both are run by the same company . the report said that women and children seeking asylum , `` whose trauma histories and emotional needs may be more severe and require more specialized training , '' were at greater risk of harm . among other recommendations , the commission urged that a high-level protector of refugees be appointed to monitor the system and correct inequities . manny van pelt , a spokesman for immigration and customs enforcement , an agency within homeland security that oversees the detention of asylum seekers , defended the system . `` we have a robust inspections program that conducts audits of our detention facilities nationwide , and our detention facilities are accredited and subjected to regular inspection by the u.n . high commission for refugees , '' he said in an interview . `` they are clean and they are safe environments . even better , the detention system protects the public. '' the commission had been asked by congress to examine the effectiveness of the nation 's asylum regulations , created in part as a response to the 1993 world trade center bombings , in an effort to balance the country 's desire to shelter those suffering from persecution abroad with its need to keep out criminals and terrorists . the system , known as expedited removal , requires those seeking asylum at airports and borders to be sent back immediately unless they are found to have a `` credible fear '' of persecution when questioned by immigration officers . those who pass the test -- a vast majority -- are then detained until an immigration judge decides the validity of their claim . unless they are released pending a decision , the average detainee is held for 64 days and a third stay more than 90 days -- some even years , the report found . the number of asylum seekers , and the rate at which they are freed , have both dropped sharply since the terrorist attacks of 2001 , the study showed . but rates of asylum also differed sharply by national groups between 2000 and 2004 , with more than 80 percent of cubans given a permanent right to stay , along with more than 60 percent of iraqis . by contrast , just more than 10 percent of those from haiti and fewer than 5 percent of those from ei salvador were granted asylum . detainees represented by lawyers were up to 30 times more likely to gain asylum , but in some places fewer than half the detainees had lawyers . with the exception of the operation at george bush intercontinental airport in houston , the report found that asylum seekers were not pressed to withdraw their asylum claims before the interview , nor were claims summarily denied . but it found that judges often wrongly used airport statements to deny asylum later . before the change in the law , only asylum seekers with criminal records were detained . now , nearly all are locked up with ordinary criminals . in 2003 , 5 , 585 men and 1 , 015 women seeking asylum were jailed . to cut down on that number , the commission recommended that the airport interviewers , and not just immigration judges , be given the authority to grant asylum on the spot when warranted . severe psychological damage is among the effects of throwing people seeking refuge together with criminals in `` stark conditions , '' the report said , describing 24-hour lights , chained walks to go eat , no privacy even to use the toilet and little chance to exercise outdoors . detainees are allowed to work but paid $ 1 a day . five of the 19 detention centers examined had mental health staff , and none had guards trained to work with victims of torture or repression . in most places the treatment for those considered suicidal was solitary confinement . a footnote pointed out that isolation was `` likely to exacerbate depression , '' not prevent suicide . `` the whole detention system is there to break you down further , '' one former detainee told interviewers in the report . `` you are not even allowed to cry . if you do , they take you to isolation. '' cut off from the outside world and not allowed incoming calls , even from a lawyer , the detainees are at high risk for depression , the commission said , and some even said they gave up their quest for asylum because of the unbearable conditions . since the 1996 change in immigration law , critics have complained that the system is subjecting those fleeing torture and repression to harsh conditions in detention that can drag on for years . but this is the first bipartisan examination based on an inside view . one of the republican commission members , michael k. young , the president of the university of utah and an adviser to president george h. w. bush , said great pains were taken to make the two-year effort politically balanced . `` that is one of the things that gives this report real strength , '' he said . preeta d. bansal , a democrat who chaired the commission , said more research is needed , especially on the reasons for the sharp drop in asylum seekers . `` we have been told that in foreign countries the department of homeland security is being employed to prevent people from even getting on board airplanes , '' said ms. bansal , a former solicitor general of new york state . `` we think further follow-up needs to be done. '' the report comes the same week that asylum legislation is to be introduced in the house by representative f. james sensenbrenner jr. , a wisconsin republican and chairman of the judiciary committee . among other visions , the bill , known as the real id act , would make it harder for refugees to get asylum . so we have a bipartisan committee on international religious freedom critical of our denial of asylum rights . and what is the response of the majority ? let us make a bad situation worse . mr. speaker , why not an open amendment procedure so those of us who have paid attention to this report could offer amendments that embody it ? why will we not be allowed to offer amendments from this interreligious commission , and it is an interreligious commission . i know one of the problems the majority has , and i sympathize , but apparently somebody has bowdlerized their bibles . and i sympathize ; these are people who have bibles , but their bibles have big things missing . for example , we often hear leviticus quoted on the floor of the house . leviticus 19 , chapters 33 and 34 , `` when an alien lives with you in your land , do not mistreat him . the alien living with you must be treated as one of your native-born . love him as yourself , for you were aliens in egypt. '' now , that is in leviticus . i know leviticus gets turned on and off here like an electric bulb , but it does now seem to me that kind of cafeteria approach to religion is something the majority has adopted . here we have it in leviticus . this is undoubtedly why the catholic bishops have spoken out against this bill and have asked some of us to oppose it . but again , religion is to be invoked selectively so religious values are for another time , not when there is political hay to be made by taking this popular stance . what we have is an undemocratic procedure being mobilized to suppress , even debate , and an opportunity to consider the report of this commission in the service of a doctrine which would seem to me to violate some fundamental religious principles . i guess the majority has the votes to do that if they want to , but they have a day to reconsider , and i hope perhaps something will change their minds .

"mr. speaker , does the gentleman really believe that 20 minutes of debate , 10 on each side , on these complicated issues , is free and flowing debate ? we got out early yesterday ; we are here today . why only 10 minutes of debate on each side on these complicated issues ? ",D
"mr. speaker , hearing the chairman of the committee on rules describe this restricted rule as fair and balanced reinforces the fact that when people on the right in america politically tell you something is fair and balanced , you had better ask for another deck of cards . the rule not only limits the amendments ; and it makes sense , the chairman 's defense makes sense if you start from the perspective that no amendments ought to be allowed . and then when you let in two out of 10 , or two out of six , somehow you have been generous . ought not the assumption be in favor of openness , especially since the house has not been doing very much ? then the chairman said , well , we do not have to have long debate on these things ; after all , we had a hearing in the committee on rules , and it was streamed on line . anyone who thinks that a hearing in the committee on rules that is streamed on line is a substitute for open and free debate in the united states house of representatives , or anyone who says that , ought to remember , i would give just one piece of advice . no matter how pressed one feels in a debate , try to avoid saying something that no one is going to believe . it really does not help your cause . no one thinks that an online hearing in the committee on rules with a handful of members in a room that has 30 seats substitutes for free and open debate in the house of representatives , and particularly when you only give 10 minutes on a particular amendment . i want to talk about the amendment on asylum . we heard a lot of discussion last year in the election from people complaining that religion had been driven from the public square . well , guess who is ignoring religion this year ? the majority . the provisions on asylum have evoked overwhelming opposition from the various religious communities in america . i noted yesterday that the commission on interreligious freedom set up by this congress to protect religious freedom in the world put out earlier this week a report saying that our asylum procedures are too restrictive . and what is the response of the majority ? to make what the commission on interreligious freedom says is a bad situation much worse . i noted yesterday , in leviticus it says , and i have looked at various translations , various renderings , and in every one it sometimes says `` stranger , '' it sometimes says `` alien. '' it is clear it means people we would describe as immigrants . it says , treat them as you would treat the native born . now , i do not purport to be a religious scholar . i do not purport to be an expert in religious interpretation , but i am puzzled . can we turn leviticus on and off that way ? i mean , often i have heard leviticus quoted as justification for measures that are critical of homosexuals . do you not have to take it as a package ? i mean , if you are going to use leviticus to disadvantage homosexuals , do you not have to use it to be nice to immigrants ? is it not true that what is leviticus for the goose is leviticus for the gander ? again , i acknowledge i am not a theological expert , so i will turn to some who are . i got a copy yesterday from the interfaith statement . `` the real id act , '' it says , `` threatens the ability of victims of persecution to find safe haven in the united states , '' signed by a variety of jewish and catholic and protestant groups , the jesuit religious service , the episcopal migration ministries , the church world service , the jubilee campaign , the lutheran immigration and refugee service . mr. speaker , because i do not think that religion ought to be driven from the public square on an issue on which there is such an overwhelming religious consensus , i will offer a statement condemning this bill and its asylum provisions be inserted here . real id act threatens ability of victims of persecution to find safe haven in the united states as representatives of various faith traditions , we are deeply concerned that the real id act , legislation proposed by representative jim sensenbrenner ( r-wi ) , would make asylum a more remote possibility for hundreds of persons who need protection . we understand that safeguarding our national security is an urgent issue , and we support measures that honor that concern . we also subscribe to core beliefs which require that we provide safety to victims of persecution , particularly those who have no recourse to the projection that democratic societies traditionally provide . restricting access to asylum beyond current practice and does not serve the cause of national security and , moreover , erodes a sacred and legal responsibility to give safety to those whose only protection comes from asylum . each of our traditions has witnessed the suffering of persons whose beliefs often place them in jeopardy and possibly in mortal danger . as american-based faith communities , we have cherished the ability of asylum seekers to find safety in communities around our nation . we are , therefore , saddened by a further erosion of our asylum system under the pretext of national security . we urge members of congress to reject the notion that all asylees are prospective terrorists and that the current system needs to be made more restrictive . the belief that we must receive persons who have been rejected and persecuted because of their ideas and religious practices is anchored in both our histories and sacred texts . we have contributed over the years to supporting and enriching practices which embrace hospitality as not only a religious but an american value . we also appreciate the need to prevent terrorism from violating both our freedom and safety . we believe that hospitality to the stranger -- particularly one who has been persecuted -- and security are compatible national goals . we , therefore , reject legislation that subverts hospitality in the name of security . the current asylum system includes rigorous safeguards against terrorists abusing the asylum system . the changes proposed by the real id act raise a false issue in further victimizing legitimate asylum seekers . requiring unreasonable levels of evidence to prove an asylum claim , placing a greater burden on asylum seekers to convince reviewers of the key motivation of their accusers , and allowing subjective considerations to guide the review process all send a chilling message to those who desperately seek the safety and protection which they have a right to expect of our great nation . we have all seen how fear can pervert justice . we believe that the religious traditions which we embrace calls us to oppose a narrowing of the door to asylum by some of the world 's most at-risk persons . we are committed to resisting a fear driven agenda which violates our faith-based principles . mr. speaker , the asylum provisions make it much harder for people to get asylum . we will have 20 minutes to debate this issue . it would take me half of that time to read the full list of signers . last week , we were visited , those of us on the democratic side , by a representative of the catholic bishops , who asked us specifically to oppose this bill and particularly to condemn the asylum provisions . i do not think there has been any showing that asylumees have been terrorists . but , in any case , i do want to stress , those of you who have said we have insufficiently paid attention to religious values , mr. speaker , i urge them not to turn their back on the religious community now and not to give the religious communities , a broad range of them , 10 minutes in which we can make the case that this bill violates biblical injunctions about aliens and undercuts our mission to be a haven for the religiously persecuted . ",D
"mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 1268 making supplemental appropriations to ensure that our forces who are hard at work in iraq and afghanistan , and elsewhere , have the tools they need to do their job , and are well protected . mr. speaker , this week we witnessed the establishment of iraq 's first democratically elected government in over half a century and their swearing in . this event is yet another historic milestone in iraq 's progress toward a representative and transparent government . but even as we see important movement toward democracy , we are reminded that `` freedom is not free. '' as those of us who have seen war know , it is paid first by the sacrifices of those who serve . their courage is our inspiration . we wish them godspeed , swift victory and safe return . however , while it pales in comparison to the sacrifices of our brave men and women in the field , there is another part of the equation . and it is before us today . with this legislation , congress is acting decisively to ensure that our soldiers , sailors and airmen have the resources they need to keep iraq on the road back to the community of civilized nations . this bill contains over $ 76 billion to support military activities . this sum will : pay for the troop deployment ; repair and replace damaged vehicles being chewed up in an extreme harshly operating environment ; replenish stores of munitions and supplies ; and provide additional armor for vehicles , improved communications gear and more night-vision equipment . i would also add that this bill also provides over $ 60 million for additional electronic devices designed to protect our forces from the `` weapon of choice '' of the insurgents -- ieds . mr. speaker , this `` wartime supplemental '' appropriations bill meets our military , humanitarian and foreign policy requirements . we have every reason to be proud of young men and women at war . every single word of praise uttered on this floor today is justified . but while our young men and women in uniform appreciate our vocal support , they need this bill . it will provide them with the tools they need to get their job done as quickly as possible so they can return home to their families . i commend mr. lewis , the chairman of the appropriations committee -- the gentleman from california -- for his leadership . and i urge passage of the legislation . ",R
"mr. chairman , i offer an amendment . ",R
"mr. chairman , the question before us today , i believe , is how now shall we live within the confines of the budget that we have to deal with ? shall we live within the boundaries that we have set for ourselves and set an example for our generation today and the future , or should we ignore those boundaries that we have imposed upon ourselves and spend in excess ? right now we are in the process , as we know , of doing the budget for next year , the 2006 budget . we are setting up the framework of what we will be spending for next year . and so i think it is fitting and appropriate that we look at the supplemental today and the amendment that i have presented to see whether or not we will fit within that budget confines , whether or not we will fit within that area or , instead , will we exceed it and say that a budget really is nothing more than a charade and not explain exactly what we will be spending for any point in time . let me just say that i applaud the chairman , and i applaud the members of the committee for doing what they said they would do as has been reported in the paper . to use the chairman 's own words , they have taken the president 's proposal and scrubbed it thoroughly for many points that they thought appropriate to remove from that spending proposal . my question , though , is , can we do a little bit better ? can we go a little bit further ? can we do exactly what we ask families to do back at home ? think for a moment . what would a family do today if they faced emergency expenditures like we are looking at in the supplemental right now , families who maybe have to see extra car payments or medical expenses ? what would a family do ? a family would probably have to do what we should be doing right here , and that is limit our spending elsewhere , reduce some other unnecessary spending so that we have that money for the emergency spending . if we look in the supplemental , there are a number of points in there that have already been raised by others . i will just point to one of them , the aid for tsunami victims . that started at $ 35 million , went up to $ 150 million , then $ 350 million , and now we are looking at $ 950 million . some would question whether we can even spend all that before the end of this fiscal year . as a matter of fact , i spoke with people from the world bank and they said that they are not even sure where the money would all be going to . they do not have an exact figure as to what we should be spending on long-term needs , so we can question whether or not we should be spending that money . but given that we can argue that back and forth , let us take that as a given that we should spend the entire $ 950 million for tsunami relief . i would ask this , as we stand here before the world as a body saying that we are going to do the charitable thing and give money to the tsunami victims , are we really exercising any charity there when we , in fact , say , we 're not going to be paying for it , we 're asking our kids and our grandkids to pay for it in excessive spending and deficit spending in future generations ? again , i applaud the chairman for the good start that they have done in this committee by scrubbing the budget and trying to find some offsets . i would simply say , can we not do a little bit better and find completely all offsets for all of the spending that we are doing , aside from the military defense spending , for all the excessive spending in the bill ? it is around $ 4 billion . how much would it really come out to be ? if you are looking at the budget that we have right now that we are living under , $ 2.5 trillion , and you are trying to find savings or offsets of around $ 4 billion , that is only two- tenths of 1 percent . i would ask , can we not find two-tenths of 1 percent of waste , fraud and abuse in the entire fiscal budget that we are operating under right now ? i think we can . we ask families to do it for their budgets , we ask businesses to do it for their budgets , i think we can find that entire amount of approximately $ 4 billion of waste , fraud , and abuse in the entire budget , offset it , and then we can truly stand before the world and say that when we are making charitable contributions to the tsunami relief victims , that it is truly coming from this generation and not being passed on to future generations . i shall end where i began . how now shall we live ? we shall live within the means , by the parameters that we have set down upon ourselves . we shall live within the budget that we have set for ourselves and not outside that budget . ",R
"mr. chairman , i am sorry , i should have stepped in before the gentleman stood up to say , in light of knowing the rules of the house , that i was about to withdraw the amendment . ",R
"mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me the time . mr. speaker , i want to thank both the chairman and the ranking member for this bill , especially for its iraqi dollars , because this bill analyzes microscopically the kinds of equipment that is needed there now , and then surgically targets those dollars in a vastly efficient manner for our troops . the bill also deals with healing the wounds of both mind and body of those soldiers who are returning . the bill also deals with small businesses being able , through the h-2b process , to hire legal workers . and the bill also deals with enhanced technology for the tsunami situation that we saw so much , months ago . i want to thank the gentleman from california ( mr. lewis ) xz4002391 for the legislation , and i urge its adoption . mr. speaker , i would like to address the $ 17 million included in the supplemental that we are considering today , which will support the expansion of the u.s. tsunami warning network . these funds will help noaa to procure and deploy tsunami detection buoys in a system designed to provide continuous tsunami warning capability for both the pacific and atlantic coasts of the united states . detection is a critical part of a warning system which i hope will ultimately include a comprehensive approach to educating communities about , and preparing them for , tsunamis . comprising 70 percent of the earth 's surface area , our oceans support a growing source of protein for many developing countries , promising sources of medicines , and efficient transport of goods between continents and among nations . they also strongly influence our climate and weather and provide economic and unmeasurable quality of life benefits . for proof of this , one only needs to know that the u.s. coasts support over 50 percent of the u.s. population and comprise only 17 percent of our land base . when south asia was struck by tsunami waves on december 26 , the world 's interest in tsunami detection and warning systems was heightened . the impact of these waves was felt around the world , and the tragedy of its immediate effect on indian ocean coastlines has painfully exposed our lack of ability to provide early warning and coastal community education and support . many lifelong residents of indian ocean coastal towns fear the sea -- the primary source of their livelihoods for generations . it is critical that individuals in high-risk areas are educated about and prepared for tsunamis before they strike . coastal communities need assurance that technology exists and will be applied to increase warnings for such events and to prepare them for evacuation to avoid catastrophic loss of human life . in contrast , developed nations use increasing technological sophistication to acquire from the sea its bounty -- with little thought for the long-term sustainability of this activity . in time , without increased understanding of our ocean ecosystems and the impact of our harvest and extraction of its resources , developed nations may also come to fear the sea . the antidote to the disease of fear is understanding . new technologies have already led to enormous advances in our understanding of the coastal and marine environment . however , advanced sensors have been deployed only on relatively small scales , and the systems that are deployed have not been coordinated into an integrated system that will optimize our understanding of the oceans . since the u.s. hosted the earth observation summit in july 2003 , we have been working with our partner nations to adopt a comprehensive , coordinated and sustained earth observation system to collect and disseminate data , information and models for more effective and responsible use of our resources as well as to inform decision-makers about impending disasters . most recently , the u.s. commission on ocean policy made an integrated ocean observing system a top recommendation in its report , an ocean blueprint for the 21st century . our space exploration and our weather programs show that when our scientists and the nation support a program and devote time , money and , most importantly , the human mind into these types of endeavors we are highly successful . the ocean , however , is often referred to as the last frontier , a place where we continue to find new organisms and species and where we still struggle to understand the profound implications for climate changes and more direct impacts of the oceans on our human habitats . there is perhaps no more motivating event , no louder a voice for attention and understanding than having the ocean engulf human habitats . our failure to fully develop and utilize our technology to understand our oceans has many more implications , including the potential for permanent damage to fragile and complex ecosystems that have generously provided us with food , medicines , recreation , and other benefits . we are now awake to the power of the ocean , and it is my hope that we will use this opportunity to move more quickly toward integrated data collection and dissemination systems , as well as intensive education of coastal communities , to ensure that we and future generations can look to the sea for inspiration , sustenance , and life-giving support . i strongly support the inclusion of these funds to increase global monitoring capacity and public awareness about tsunamis and other disasters , particularly if they add to capacity of ocean monitoring as part of the global earth observation system of systems ( geoss ) .

"mr. speaker , i thank my colleague on the committee on rules . i rise in full support of the rule and the underlying bill . i remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle , who keep saying , we are not given enough time and we are rushing all of these complicated issues that we have not discussed , but these provisions i remind my colleagues , they were in the original bill that we passed on the house side , the intel bill . unfortunately , they were taken out by the senate conferees . we are asking to do the things that the 9/11 commission , all 10 of them , in their unanimous report , asked us to do . listen to this : `` if terrorist travel options are reduced , they may be forced to rely on means of interaction which can be more easily monitored and to resort to travel documents which are more readily detectable. '' the 9/11 commission report , page 65 , `` all but one of the 9/11 hijackers acquired some form of united states identification document , some by fraud. '' acquisition of these forms of identification would have assisted them in boarding commercial flights , renting cars , and other necessary activities . the 9/11 commission report , page 390 , `` my daughter worked at the republican convention this summer . i worried about her . unbeknownst to me , during the convention an illegal alien from pakistan was picked up and arrested for attempting to bomb the herald square subway station . she rode on that subway every day going back and forth to work. '' he was quoted as saying , `` i want at least 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 to die in a single day. '' and that alien had applied for asylum . mr. speaker , these are sensible provisions . we are completing the work of the intel bill , and i support it . we need to get it done and we need bipartisan support . ",R
"mr. speaker , i am not on the committee on the judiciary . ",R
"mr. speaker , i wanted to come to the floor today to speak in favor of reforming our system for asylum and against the move to strike the necessary reforms incorporated in h.r. 418 . it has been suggested throughout out this debate yesterday and today that because there is no specific recommendation made by the 9-11 commission to reform our asylum system that we in congress should do nothing to fix it . that in my opinion is insane . my colleagues and friends on the other side of the isle suggest we stick our heads in the sand and ignore one of the tools used by terrorists to gain access to and remain in our country . make no mistake , the 9-11 commission report does specifically state that our asylum system was and is used by terrorists to carry out their schemes to kill americans . let me quote from the report and its accompanying statements : the report states , speaking of the first trade center bombing , `` ... ..ramazi yousef , who had also entered with fraudulent documents but claimed political asylum and was admitted . it quickly became clear that yousef had been a central player in the attack . he had fled to pakistan immediately after the bombing and would remain at large for nearly two years. '' later in the report it talks about the outdated immigration benefits system , `` ... ..when doris meissner became ins commissioner in 1993 , she found ... .. the asylum and other benefits systems did not effectively deter fraudulent applicants . finally , `` terrorists in the 1990s , as well as the september 11 hijackers , needed to find a way to stay in or embed themselves in the united states if their operational plans were to come to fruition. '' `` this could be accomplished ... .. by applying for asylum after entering . in many cases , the act of filing for an immigration benefit ( such as claiming asylum ) sufficed to permit the alien to remain in the country until the petition was adjudicated . terrorists were free to conduct surveillance , coordinate operations , obtain and receive funding , go to school and learn english , make contacts in the united states , acquire necessary materials , and execute an attack. '' so , if i am to understand my friends on the other side , we are to ignore the problem of asylum abuse and do nothing . ",R
"mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to h.r. 418 . the first thing is america will not sleep any more securely with the passage of this piece of legislation , as well intended as it may be , because i am not going to question the motives of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle . but why do a useless thing ? why would the state legislatures , why would the state governors , why would every latino advocacy group come against this ? why would the national council of bishops here in the states come out against this ? it is for various reasons . but they all acknowledge that there is not a conspiracy going on here to thwart the efforts at security by these groups . no one would accuse these individuals of that , because this does not do anything . it only burdens the state and does not get us anywhere . but more importantly , and i really believe this , this is an anti-immigrant bill in the guise of some sort of security consideration , which it does not further . and so we ask , who are these immigrants ? i have a simple answer for all of us . look in the mirror . that is who we are talking about . we all got here one way or another , some earlier than others . we are all immigrants . what this bill is really about is not bad people coming into this country to do bad things to this country . it is about preventing good people coming into this country to do good things . ",D
"mr. chairman , i rise today in support of h.r. 418 , the real id act . i supported the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act last december . that legislation helped to streamline the intelligence community and tightened some asylum rules that allowed potential terrorists to remain in our country . that was a good bill , but it did not go far enough . so i am pleased that the house is debating h.r. 418 -- a bill that i believe will continue to strengthen our borders , further improve identification standards , and close even more asylum loopholes . we know that mohamed atta and his gang of terrorists exploited weak identification rules , and , as stated in the 9/11 commission report , `` all but one of the 9/11 hijackers acquired some form of identification document , some by fraud. '' h.r. 418 will require that federal agencies only accept licenses and state-issued id cards when states have determined that the holder is lawfully present in the country . the bill will also require that temporary visitors to our country receive only temporary identification , and that this identification expire when the terms of the visit expire . mr. chairman , this only makes sense . i am also pleased that this bill further reforms our asylum system , a system that has unfortunately been ripe for corruption for years . we are also addressing the san diego border fence issue and will ensure the expeditious completion of the border fence . further , the bill makes aliens deportable for terrorism-related offenses . incredibly , current law provided that not all terrorism-related grounds for keeping an alien out of the country are also grounds for deportion . this bill closes that loophole . the simple fact is that we need to secure our borders . today 's bill is another step toward this effort and i believe it will make our country safer . i urge my colleagues to support the real id act . ",R
"mr. chairman , i come to the floor today to speak in support of the real id act . it is clear that in order to secure our country from terrorists we need to reform the requirements and standards for driver 's licenses . a valid driver 's license is like a hall pass that allows terrorists to easily roam throughout the united states . indeed 19 terrorists did just that with dozens of legal driver 's licenses and identification cards . the hijackers used these ids to rent cars and apartments , open bank accounts , take flying lessons , and otherwise blend into american society while they planned their attacks . those terrorists murdered 3 , 000 americans and yet this gap still remains open . in every state , the driver 's license ( and its counterpart , the state id card ) is the primary document used to establish identity and proof of legal residence . making driver 's licenses accessible to illegal aliens gives them the means to pass themselves off as legal residents of the united states . additionally , the real id act does not create a national id card . in addition to establishing standards for the issuance of licenses , h.r. 418 includes provisions to prevent terrorists from gaming our asylum system . court decisions in recent years have so distorted the asylum process that terrorists are now able to claim asylum specifically because they are terrorists . this legislation represents a critical first step toward gaining control over our borders and protecting american lives . these are common-sense measures that should be implemented immediately . terrorism may have no borders , but we can certainly make it more difficult for terrorists to cross ours . having a uniform policy that relies on common sense will do more to keep america open and free than having a policy that relies on hope .

"mr. chairman , i move to strike the last word and enter into a brief colloquy with the gentleman from arizona ( mr. kolbe ) xz4002260 . mr. chairman , i believe it is important that all groups and organizations that want to assist in the recovery are allowed to participate . the united states agency for international development issued a regulation on october 19 , 2004 , that ensures religious organizations are allowed to compete on an equal footing with other nongovernmental organizations for usaid funding , in the case of this bill , funding to help tsunami victims . can the chairman clarify whether the appropriations under this bill fall under such regulation ?

",R
"mr. chairman , i rise today in strong opposition to h.r. 418 . i am deeply concerned about several aspects of this proposed legislation . this legislation , if passed , would be a terrible setback with regards to three critical areas : defending the people of the united states from terrorism , due process for immigrants , and environmental protection . the bill would undo security provisions that were passed just last year under the intelligence reform act . families of september 11th victims stated the impact of this legislation will not make us safer from terrorism . instead , it would prevent people from fleeing persecution , from obtaining relief , making our highways more dangerous and undermine our security . section 102 of this bill would eliminate homeland security and border patrol 's responsibility to inform and involve communities in proposed construction projects along the entire u.s. border and the requirement to consider less harmful alternatives to proposed actions . this would allow homeland security to operate in secrecy in critically important areas such as cabeza prieta and buenos aires national wildlife refuge and organ pipe national monument that are all in my district . many of our most precious wildlife depend upon protected public lands along u.s. borderlands for migration corridors between countries . in addition , this section would waive laws requiring consultations with native nations regarding activities on tribal lands , grave sites or archaeological and sacred sites . finally , in a rush to deport anyone , h.r. 418 would deny due process for immigrants and asylum seekers . this is un-american . it is against what we stand for , and it is against what we are asking the world to replicate in democracy across this earth . ",D
"mr. chairman , i rise today in strong opposition to h.r. 418 . the proponents of this dangerous and divisive bill have mischaracterized and misrepresented it as a measure that focuses on national security . this could not be further from the truth . i would urge my colleagues today to listen beyond the harsh rhetoric and to closely examine this legislation . because further study will reveal that h.r. 418 is really nothing more than a bill designed to bash immigrants and punish refugees . h.r. 418 ignores our nation 's proud history of protecting those fleeing brutal human rights abuses , torture and persecution . it would force our country to turn its back on women , children , and victims of religious persecution . the bill would create insurmountable hurdles for legitimate asylum-seekers and slam the door shut on refugees who have fled brutal human rights abuses . that is not america . h.r. 418 also ignores the reality that there are an estimated 10 million or more undocumented immigrants living in our country . this bill would do nothing to prevent undocumented migration to the united states . if anything , this bill will only further compound the flaws in our nation 's immigrations laws . and it would make the job of protecting our homeland even more challenging . h.r. 418 will make the vital job of law enforcement to arrest criminals and root out potential terrorists almost impossible . in short , immigration enforcement will continue to expend their valuable , but limited , resources and energy in pursuing hardworking busboys and nannies , instead of bad actors who mean us real harm . immigration officers represent our frontline forces in protecting our homeland . let 's not make their jobs even more demanding . let 's give them the policies , the resources and the tools they need to succeed . mr. chairman , imagine your neighbors , the families who live across the street , the men and women who join us at church -- all of the hard working people who share the roads with us . now imagine these hundreds of thousands , perhaps millions of people , driving without a license , without car insurance or registration . such a policy will wreak havoc on our streets and highways . it also will do nothing to address our broken immigration system . it will just force hard working people further into the shadows and create an increased demand for the black market of fake identity documents . i agree that congress must examine how to improve enforcement of immigration law , but we first must create laws that are enforceable and in step with reality . let me close by saying this . i am not alone in my strong opposition to this misguided and mean-spirited legislation . also opposing the bill are the national governor 's association , the national council of state legislatures , many other national , state and local organizations , security and immigration policy experts , immigration attorneys , more than 100 religious organizations , hispanic and asian organizations , the u.n . commissioner for refugees , the afl-cio , the service employees international union and other labor unions . the list goes on and on , and i consider myself very good company . mr. chairman , i strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this bill . the only thing `` real '' about the real id act is that it is real bad for america . ",D
"mr. speaker , i thank my colleague who ably serves on the permanent select committee on intelligence , as well as the committee on rules , for the time . mr. speaker , as the lead conferee on the intelligence reform bill , i oppose the rule on h.r. 418 and the underlying bill because they will not make us safer . what h.r. 418 will do is undermine several key provisions of the bipartisan intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act , which congress passed and the president signed into law just 2 months ago . those who claim that the so-called real id act will enhance national security are flat wrong . remember , all of the september 11 hijackers entered this country with legal immigration documents . legislation prohibiting illegal immigrants from obtaining driver 's licenses would not have stopped a single 9/11 hijacker . we dealt with this issue responsibly in the intelligence reform legislation . the law establishes tough minimum federal standards for driver 's licenses so that all driver 's licenses have certain key security features . the law also requires the transportation security administration to set newer standards within 6 months for identification documents which may be used to board commercial airplanes . these provisions are much stronger than what is being proposed by h.r. 418 , yet h.r. 418 would repeal these critical new security upgrades . mr. speaker , i wholeheartedly agree that if we want to cut down on illegal immigration , we must improve border security . just 2 weeks ago , an astute crane operator at the port of los angeles discovered 32 chinese stowaways in a container that had just been unloaded from a panamanian freighter . the state of california already prohibits illegal immigrants from getting a driver 's license , but that did not discourage these stowaways from trying to sneak into california and the united states . the people at our ports and our borders are our first line of defense . that is why the intelligence reform bill included authorization for 10 , 000 new border guards , 40 , 000 new detention beds to hold people awaiting deportation , and 4 , 000 new immigration inspectors . yet the president 's 2006 budget does not include funding for any of these new security improvements . if we are going to serious about border security , we need more resources and more people at the border . i urge my colleagues to retain the real id provisions in the intelligence reform bill and reject this imposter . we already have the tools for securing driver 's licenses , and our borders that will truly make our country safer . ",D
"mr. chairman , many on this side of the aisle also support strong border protection . i certainly do , and i support the fence . this is not an argument , however , about whether to build a fence . it is about what process should be used , and this process is dead wrong . rather than reaching out to the governor of california , a leader in the party on the other side of the aisle , to reach compromise on this issue , the author of this bill has crafted language that will usurp all of governor schwarzenneger 's power regarding the border fence . to take the radical steps of eliminating all state and local powers , let alone federal , and rolling back all judicial review is the height of irresponsible legislating . mr. chairman , this bill sets the dangerous precedent of policing a single federal official , elected by no one , above all laws , and shields him from accountability , and the reach is beyond the san diego border . according to the language in this legislation , it is all areas along and in the vicinity of our international borders with both mexico and canada . this is the wrong way to do it . we need to do the right thing . mr. chairman , i support this amendment .

"mr. speaker , the real id act completes the mission of the 9/11 commission recommendations by implementing common sense reforms to strengthen our borders security and better protect our homeland . driver 's licenses have become the primary identification document in the united states , enabling individuals to get other identity documents , transfer funds to a u.s. bank account , obtain access to federal buildings and other vulnerable facilities , purchase a firearm , rent a car and board a plane . lax standards and loopholes in the current issuance processes allow terrorists to obtain driver 's licenses -- often multiple licenses from different states -- and abuse the license for identification purposes . the sept 11th hijackers had , within their possession , at least 15 valid drivers licenses and numerous state issued identity cards with a large variety of addresses . identification documents are the last opportunity to ensure that people are who they say they are and to check whether they are terrorists . the real id act would require applicants to provide proof they are in the country legally . currently , eleven states do not have such a requirement , meaning a majority of states have already recognized the need for tighter standards , but unnecessary and dangerous gaps in the system still exist . the real id act would require identity documents to expire at the same time as the expiration of lawful entry status , preventing those who have illegally entered or are unlawfully present in the u.s. from having valid identification documents . states would still issue driver 's licenses and identification cards and would control their own driver database . the 9-11 commission 's staff report on `` 9-11 and terrorist travel '' found that `` a number of terrorists . . . abused the asylum system '' . examples of terrorists abusing our asylum laws : the `` blind sheik '' , sheik omar abdel rahman , led a plot to bomb new york city landmarks . rahman used an asylum application to avoid deportation to egypt after all other means of remaining in the u.s. failed . the 9/11 commission staff report noted than an immigration judge held a hearing on rahman 's asylum claim weeks before his followers bombed the worid trade center . during the republican convention last august , an illegal alien from pakistan was picked up and arrested for attempting to bomb the herald square subway station and plotting to bomb the verrazano narrows bridge . he was quoted as saying that `` i want at least 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 to die in one day. '' the alien had applied for asylum . a number of courts , specifically the 9th circuit court has severely undermined current authorities by limiting the factors that judges can consider when assessing the credibility of an alien seeking asylum . this impairment encourages asylum fraud . the real id act would strengthen judges ' ability to determine whether the asylum seeker is truthful . this provision codifies the factors immigration judges use to assess credibility and prevents the 9th circuit from further undermining our national security . in 1996 congress approved building the 14 mile long san diego border fence on the mexico-u.s. border , right next to a major u.s. navy base . the san diego sector covers an area of more than 7 , 000 square miles and contains 66 linear miles of international border with mexico . directly to the south of the san diego sector area of responsibility lie the mexican cities of tijuana and tecate , which have a combined population of more than two million . for decades , this area had been the preferred corridor for entry into the united states by unknown or undocumented persons due to the highly populated cities north and south of the border , as well as relatively quick access to national transportation hubs such as lax . construction of the fence was halted when radical environmentalists claimed that the area was a habitat of a rare bird . as a result , eight years later , the fence remains incomplete and is an opportunity for aliens to cross the border illegally . this incomplete fence allows border security gaps to remain open . we must close these gaps because they remain a threat to our national security . the real id act will require the completion of this important security fence . under current immigration laws , prohibitions on some terrorist-related activities only apply to aliens who are trying to enter the u.s. , but not to those who already reside within our borders . therefore , if an alien seeking a visa has been found to participate in certain terrorist-related activity , he/she is prohibited from entering the u.s. but if an alien is found to have participated in the same terrorist activity in the u.s. , he/she may not be deportable . the real id act would finally make the laws consistent by providing that all terrorist-related offenses and making aliens inadmissible which would also be grounds for their deportation . the real id act provides that any alien contributing funds to a terrorist organization would be deportable .

"mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume , and thank the gentleman from texas ( mr. sessions ) xz4003670 for yielding me time . mr. speaker , i rise today to oppose this rule and h.r. 418 . the anti-immigrant provisions contained in this bill are unconscionable . we are a nation of immigrants , a nation that people , from time immemorial , have journeyed to for freedom . as ronald reagan said , `` america is a shining light on the hill. '' well , apparently , mr. speaker , today that light is red . we find ourselves in the second week of the second month of this legislative session , and we have yet to have a bill come to the floor with an open rule . and i remind the majority that that is shutting america out with reference to this debate . we are here today without a final rule because of a lack of agreement on which amendments to allow . well , i have a simple solution , one that should be obvious to all of us . i say , allow all amendments to be brought to the floor for a full and free debate by the house of representatives as envisioned by this nation 's founding fathers who were immigrants . let congress work its will on this legislation . to stifle debate on a bill as ill conceived as h.r. 418 is undemocratic to the core . mr. speaker , there is no reason for hesitation . this is the only bill of substance on the house 's agenda this week . we have the opportunity to conduct an open debate on each radical section of this bill . as a country that prides itself on spreading democracy throughout the world , we must practice what we preach . allow the people to have their say by bringing h.r. 418 to the floor with an open rule . do not shut america out . the changes to asylum law contained in h.r. 418 will not improve our homeland security . terrorists do not have the right to seek asylum in our country and are already prohibited from doing so , but those who would legitimately seek refuge at our shores ought not to be turned away from our golden door through this bill 's misguided attempt at curbing immigration . nor will erosion of our personal privacy improve our security . the collection of unnecessary personal information by state agencies in an attempt to discern each and every person 's immigration standard goes against the very freedom this nation was founded on by immigrants and must be rejected . our nation 's security is of paramount importance ; but in an effort to achieve that goal , let us , a thriving nation of immigrants , not turn our backs on our history and our future . so before we replace the statue of liberty 's torch with a `` do not enter '' sign , let us reconsider in the most open of debates what that says about our great nation . mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .

gentleman from wisconsin 's ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 manager 's amendment came to the committee on rules 2 hours before we had an opportunity to see it , and i would urge in the house how many have read it even at this point . more importantly , mr. speaker , the immigration and naturalization service , bice , in the authorized budget that we presented to the president , it required 800 new officials for that agency . only 143 are in the president 's budget . i also include for the record the national conference of state legislatures ' letter in opposition and the national governors association and american association of motor vehicle administrators ' opposition to this measure . additionally , there are others who are too numerous to mention without great prolixity , but i will cite in the record some of the organizations that oppose this measure : the afl-cio ; the american jewish committee ; the anti-defamation league ; the asian american legal defense and education fund ; catholic charities usa and catholic bishops ; hebrew immigrant aid society ; the irish american unity conference ; the korean american coalition ; the mexican american legal defense and educational fund , and a footnote , all of the colleagues in the house that are latino and african american have signed on to a letter opposing this measure ; the national conference of state legislatures that i just mentioned ; the national council of la raza ; the service employees international union ; the arab-american anti-discrimination committee . and , mr. speaker , the republican liberty caucus opposes this measure . and in addition , thereto , in case someone thinks that there are a whole bunch of left wing crazies that are out here trying to protect the personal rights of individuals , the gunowners of america association opposes this measure and the american conservative union . i would think , then , that those 100-plus organizations should give us a lot of food for thought before we proceed . identity security , driver 's licenses and state identification cards states traditionally have maintained authority over the issuance of driver 's licenses and state identification cards . the principal purpose of the driver 's license is to certify individuals to operate a motorized vehicle and to secure automobile insurance . driver 's licenses also are used for numerous other purposes , including proof and verification of identity and as documents to qualify for a variety of commercial , financial , educational , governmental and other services . the driver 's licensing process and related regulatory activities are crucial for maintaining public safety , bolstering security , and reducing fraud and counterfeiting . states have renewed their scrutiny of driver 's licenses and have enacted and considered legislation to strengthen application processes , require expanded proof of identity , modify qualifications for license and identification card approval , deter fraudulent activity , and bolster privacy protections . although states retain authority over the driver 's license application and issuance processes , congress recently passed the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 to overhaul the nation 's intelligence systems . this legislation included federal standards for state issued driver 's licenses and personal identification cards that the states must enact or face the refusal of federal agencies to accept these documents for any official purpose . although ncsl opposed this federal mandate , ncsl worked with congress to ensure that state elected officials are included on a negotiated rulemaking committee , which will devise the federal standards , to apply the standards only to newly issued documents , and to require the secretary of the department of transportation to identify the cost of the federal standards on states prior to their implementation . ncsl is committed to preserving the congressional intent of the act by ensuring that state legislatures are represented on the negotiated rulemaking committee . ncsl strongly believes that the negotiated standards should provide states with maximum flexibility within the framework of the federal act to implement the standards . ncsl encourages the secretary of transportation to exercise his authority under the act to grant states extensions of the effective date if they make reasonable efforts to comply , and ncsl is committed to working with congress and the secretary to delay the implementation of the act if congress fails to appropriate funds to implement the standards . ncsl further encourages the secretary to exercise his authority under the act to include individuals from organizations that represent civil liberties and privacy interests on the negotiated rulemaking committee . although there is a need to strengthen the driver 's license application process and to address inadequacies , states remain best positioned to accomplish these goals . states have direct experience with driver 's license formatting , identity verification procedures and systems , customer service , qualifying and insuring drivers , testing potential and licensed drivers , and driver training . state laws and regulations guide these activities . states also are mindful of needs to protect consumers , taxpayers , business concerns and privacy , all of which must be taken into account while enhancing security and public safety . any federal standards should be narrowly limited to those areas enumerated in the federal act and should in no way limit the ability of states to innovate to strengthen the integrity of document verification and issuance . ncsl supports the innovative efforts at the state level to address security concerns with driver 's license issuance . currently , individual states are considering legislative and regulatory actions , interstate compacts , model legislation , intergovernmental agreements , data sharing , standards development through recognized standards-developing entities , and enhanced legislative and executive branch coordination . ncsl will provide organizational support to states as they opt to pursue any or all of these or other avenues to reform . ncsl will oppose any federal legislative or regulatory effort to require states to adopt specific model legislation or participate in an interstate compact . ncsl believes that the federal government does have a significant role in assisting states with matters regarding non-citizens and their qualification for and use of state-issued driver 's licenses and identification cards . states need direct links to verifiable , timely and accurate date regarding status , duration of stay , application for change in status and related information . the expanding number of visas , backlogs on applications for status changes and inability to either access or navigate department of homeland security data systems are among the problems requiring resolution so that states can administer non-citizen applications for driver 's licenses and identification cards . without these changes , states can not be expected to , nor be held accountable for , providing enhanced security in their driver 's license application and issuance processes.* this discussion has rekindled debate and concern about the development of a national identification card or national driver 's license . ncsl continues to believe that there is no compelling reason to establish such national cards or licenses and will work with congress and federal officials to ensure that such an establishment is not achieved -- either intentionally or unintentionally -- through legislation , regulation or rulemaking process . ncsl believes that states must establish am ore cooperative working relationship on this issue with the federal government . therefore , ncsl supports a federal role in providing technical support , highlighting successful models , facilitating discussion and providing necessary funding for changes made at the discretion of the states . ncsl is opposed to any further federal attempts including coercion or direct preemption , to usurp state authority over the driver 's license process or diminish the validity or usefulness of licenses awarded at the state level . ncsl urges the federal government to respect the provisions and intent of the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 . motor vehicle administrators , february 8 , 2005 . dear mr . speaker , representative delay and representative pelosi : we write to express our opposition to title ii of h.r. 418 , the `` improved security for driver 's licenses and personal identification cards '' provision , and h.r. 368 , the `` driver 's license security and modernization act '' . while governors and motor vehicle administrators share your concern for increasing the security and integrity of the driver 's license and state identification processes , we firmly believe that the driver 's license and id card provisions of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 offer the best course for meeting those goals . the `` driver 's licenses and personal identification cards '' provision in the intelligence reform act of 2004 provides a workable framework for developing meaningful standards to increase reliability and security of driver 's licenses and id cards . this framework calls for input from state elected officials and motor vehicle administrators in the regulatory process , protects state eligibility criteria , and retains the flexibility necessary to incorporate best practices from around the states . we have begun to work with the u.s. department of transportation to develop the minimum standards , which must be completed in 18 months pursuant to the intelligence reform act . we commend chairman sensenbrenner and chairman davis for their commitment to driver 's license integrity ; however , both h.r. 418 and h.r. 368 would impose technological standards and verification procedures on states , many of which are beyond the current capacity of even the federal government . moreover , the cost of implementing such standards and verification procedures for the 220 million driver 's licenses issued by states represents a massive unfunded federal mandate . our states have made great strides since the september 11 , 2001 terrorists attacks to enhance the security processes and requirements for receiving a valid driver 's and id card . the framework in the intelligence reform act of 2004 will allow us to work cooperatively with the federal government to develop and implement achievable standards to prevent document fraud and other illegal activity related to the issuance of driver 's licenses and id cards . we urge you to allow the provisions in the intelligence reform act of 2004 to work . governors and motor vehicle administrators are committed to this process because it will allow us to develop mutually agreed-upon standards that can truly help create a more secure america . sincerely , & lt ; center & gt ; raymond c. scheppach , & lt ; /center & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ;

"mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume , and i thank the gentleman from texas ( mr. sessions ) xz4003670 for yielding me the customary time . mr. speaker , my colleagues on the other side , for the balance of these arguments today and during yesterday , said very frequently , and it was repeated again by the gentleman from texas , that the horrible people that were on the airplanes that did the dastardly deed here in america on september 11 had , collectively , 63 driver 's licenses . that is , without any kind of misunderstanding between the two sides , they had these driver 's licenses , and there is no question about it . but one of the things that goes ignored is the fact that in the days before 9/11 , including that day , airport review of driver 's licenses did not occur , and , therefore , it is a total irrelevancy . they were in this country , some on expired visas , some with visas that had been approved , and probably one or two with fraudulent visas . what in the world did driver 's licenses have to do with it ? mr. speaker , i rise today to oppose this rule and h.r. 418 . and once again we see debate limited on this legislation for no reason . the bill is the only item on our legislative schedule today , yet debate on this bill has been limited to less than 2 hours . in fact , the number of proposed amendments has been sharply limited as well . only a fourth of the amendments submitted to the committee on rules will be allowed on the floor today , and what possible reason can the majority give for limiting debate in this matter ? surely , given the drastic nature of the changes to our asylum laws contained in h.r. 418 , it is in the best interests of the country to hold an open debate on this legislation . mr. speaker , last wednesday , the chairman of the committee on rules sent out an announcement notifying members , as is his responsibility , that all their proposed amendments to this bill were due in the committee on rules by noon on tuesday , february 8. all members who submitted their amendments , republicans and democrats , followed this rule ; all members , that is , except the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) . later tuesday afternoon , after the deadline had passed , the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) submitted an extensive 18-page amendment that made significant changes to the bill 's already controversial asylum sections . members had never seen this language before , and of course , no subcommittee or committee had a chance to review it or mark it up . in the short time we have had to review this new language , it appears to be more controversial than the bill 's original provisions . it appears to make it easier for an immigration judge to reject on asylum seeker based on subjective and cultural factors that are notoriously unreliable indicators of credibility . it also allows a person to be denied asylum based on any inconsistencies or falsehoods in their testimony , whether or not these inconsistencies are relevant to the person 's claim . i continue to harp on the fact that it does not protect children who are here and in need of asylum consideration . it does not protect women who are in forced slavery and prostitution and are raped . it does not protect them at all with reference to any asylum claims . and it places in the hands of one judge the judging of their credibility . the other thing ignored is the difficulty that the criteria set forth in h.r. 418 present to asylum seekers , legitimate asylum seekers , to collect information regarding their birth records . in the district that i represent , more than a quarter of the work done in the district offices involves immigration , and one of the things that we find it difficult to accomplish is to have the people in a timely manner who are seeking status and naturalization in this country collect their birth records and records of a variety of things in their communities that simply are not there and are unavailable , and therefore their claims are delayed repeatedly . mr. speaker , this is a bad amendment , and members should have more time to study it . what is worse is that members today will not even have the opportunity to vote up or down on it . this rule makes it a part of h.r. 418 . it is called `` self-executing. '' it sounds like a cute way of circumventing the democratic process to me . stifling free speech is downright un-american . one can not fail to see the irony here . right this minute our troops are in harm 's way to further democracy in a far-off country , while democracy here in the halls of congress is being shoved out the door . when the opportunity for a free debate is squelched , america loses , democracy loses . there is nothing to be gained by limiting ideas ; and that is what we have here today , the limiting of the ideas of the majority . they should not and it is wrong for them to shut the american people out . mr. speaker , h.r. 418 also allows the secretary of homeland security to waive all laws necessary for the construction of the san diego border wall . none of us are of a mind to believe that the completion of the 3-mile gap in that wall should not be undertaken . but giving the secretary the power to override all federal laws that interfere with this project sets a horrible precedent . these laws exist for a reason , be it to ensure the safety of the environment or to safeguard important cultural artifacts . mr. speaker , how many more laws will we override in the name of homeland security ? none of us would argue that we should not do everything to protect the homeland , but rightly we should not argue to ignore the laws that also protect us in this homeland . the data collection envisioned by h.r. 418 troubles me a lot . in this age of diminished personal privacy , this bill throws around terms such as `` mandatory facial image capture , '' and `` electronic storage of identity source documents , '' without fully explaining , and it is not explained ; and i ask anybody to explain it on the majority side , certainly for the american public , explaining fully how all this captured data will be used and by whom . i represent a district that , like america , is comprised of immigrants . many of the people of the 23rd congressional district of florida came to america as asylum seekers themselves . they came from places where notorious persecution and violation of human rights occurred , like haiti and cuba ; and they have worked hard , as many immigrants in this country who sought asylum , to create a new life for themselves and their families . whether they came 5 years ago or 50 years ago , they know others like them will continue to come to our shores fleeing persecution and desperation , seeking hope , protection and the promise of a better future . we have a moral responsibility to help them make it . it has not been lessened any more after 9/11 than it was before . the immigrants who founded this country had that moral responsibility , and throughout our history we have waxed and waned with reference to that moral responsibility . last night , i watched the so-called `` fair and balanced '' fox programming , and on that programming it happened that the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) was one of the guests . he made a sterling presentation . he did not falter in any of his principles with reference to this matter , and he went forward in a dignified manner to answer the questions asked . he did say , i believe , and he has not said that this measure is something that he does not think will help secure the homeland , as my colleague from texas has just said . but let me quote the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) from last night . he said , `` the key to protecting our homeland is enforcing the immigration laws. '' let me repeat the quote : `` the key to protecting our homeland is enforcing the immigration laws. '' now , the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) knows that president bush has proposed a budget that , rather than fulfilling what we said would protect our homeland by having 2 , 000 border patrol persons and an added number , 800 , ins , or bice , their new name , to their rolls so that we could enforce the immigration laws , what do we get in the proposed budget ? two hundred border patrol guards and 143 personnel for the immigration and naturalization service . what i am saying is let us put our emphasis where it ought to be , and let us not divert ourselves in this manner , and certainly let us not continue to shut all of those organizations , from the governors association all the way back across the board that are opposed to this law , let us not shut them out from having an opportunity to present themselves at a hearing . let us not shut out the people here in the house of representatives , some 41 who are newly here who have no idea what we did with reference to this matter last year and have not had time in order to be able to review it , sufficient to be able to make arguments on behalf of their constituencies in a satisfactory manner . let us not shut out the american public by continuing to not allow for open debate . mr. speaker , i oppose this rule and h.r. 418 . i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on the rule and this ill-conceived legislation . mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .

"mr. chairman , i rise to oppose the iraqi supplemental appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006 . to call this legislation a travesty is to put it nicely . it is nothing but $ 81 billion of chaos blanketed in lofty-sounding phrases like `` tsunami relief '' and `` supporting our troops. '' actually , this bill represents a mockery of the democratic process . calling this bill an `` emergency supplemental '' implies that the bush administration and congress were somehow not aware of these costs . that is ridiculous . the only unforeseen cost contained in this $ 81 billion dollar boondoggle is the $ 656 million for tsunami relief . both congress and the administration have known for months that $ 75 billion in the bill for the wars in iraq and afghanistan would be needed , but we did n't put it in the budget . the real story is that the bush administration is attempting to hide from the american people the real costs of a mismanaged war . the administration once claimed the war in iraq would cost $ 1.7 billion . this supplemental alone is almost 50 times that amount . is the administration out to lunch ? tomorrow , the house is going to consider a budget resolution that , like the previous year , fails to include adequate funding for the war in iraq . i 'm not a soothsayer , mr. speaker , but dare i warn , `` beware of the ides of march. '' if tomorrow 's republican budget is passed , we 're going to be here next march writing the bush administration another check to cover the costs of its campaign of nation building . the bush administration is hiding behind the rhetoric of supporting our troops to escape accountability for the war in iraq , and the american people should be outraged . we should be embarrassed that members in this body are so willing to write blank checks to a president who has yet to justify how the $ 175 billion in already appropriated money in iraq and afghanistan has been spent . mr. chairman , i am even more appalled by the manner in which funding for clandestine operations is being carried out in this bill . this bill allocates a massive amount of money for covert operations , yet the department of defense did not see fit to go through either of the two house authorizing committees of jurisdiction . congress is creating a private bank account for secretary rumsfield without any oversight or permission from the united states congress . is this what the american people want -- government by fiat ? mr. chairman , our government has a process , and this process is vital to preserving the nature of our democracy . i should n't have to explain that . all of the bush administration 's rhetoric about global freedom apparently does not extend to the united states capitol building . what is more important for the bush administration is that they get their money at all and any costs . i guess that means they will sell this bill on the altruistic notions of patriotism and humanitarianism in a snide attempt to drum up support . why is this bill being dubbed a tsunami relief effort when the entire supplemental is over 120 times the amount allocated for the tsunami ? what about the six hundred million dollars to build the world 's biggest embassy in baghdad ? what are they building this thing out of -- pure lead ? that same amount of money could go towards vital security upgrades at other embassies and consulates around the world . why do n't we just make things easier on everyone by throwing this bill out the window and opening up everyone 's bank accounts to the united states executive branch ? now that 's privatization . this is n't a question of patriotism , nor is it a question of our commitment to helping tsunami victims recover . this is an issue with short and long-term constitutional and budgetary ramifications . i realize that the bush administration feels it would be easier to simply govern without any input or oversight , but the first three articles of the constitution suggest otherwise . i can not in good conscience support legislation that , for all we know , might pour billions in the pockets of halliburton while depriving our troops of necessary resources . and i ca n't imagine why the united states congress , led by the appropriations committee , is handing a leash to the white house and waiting to be taken out for a walk . mr. chairman , i am outraged by this crass attempt to shirk congressional responsibility , and i urge my colleagues to vote against this legislation . ",D
"mr. speaker , i thank my friend from texas for yielding me time . mr. speaker , i rise in favor of the rule , and i rise in favor of the sessions amendment . the amendment makes certain that before an alien is released from dhs detention on his own recognizance pending an upcoming hearing , the immigration judge first certify that the alien is not a flight risk and , more importantly , that he does not pose a security risk to the united states . mr. speaker , i appreciate the different views that we hear in the well of this house . i understand full well dr . franklin 's admonition about the challenge confronting those who seek security and yet also wish to preserve liberty . mr. speaker , one of the reasons we are here on the floor visiting this issue today is , as the distinguished chairman of the committee on rules pointed out , while our founders believed that all men were created equal , now we have the arcanities and absurdities of certain judicial procedures that allow illegal aliens to enjoy more legal privacy in some cases than do american citizens . we need redress . i listened with great interest to my friends who came to the floor recently discovering states rights with reference to this legislation , and i believe that to be a hopeful sign . i listened with great interest to other friends who came to offer scriptural and spiritual entreaties in this debate , and i welcome that as well . but , mr. speaker , here is the fundamental question we confront . in the wake of 9/11 , in the wake of clear and demonstrable evidence that there are those who come to this nation with the intent of harming and killing americans , who are bent on the destruction of our nation and our system of government , at long last this body should take the steps necessary to preserve our security and our liberty . border security is national security . there has been lament expressed from the other side that we are moving too quickly . indeed , mr. speaker , i came to this well in a previous congress lamenting the fact that at the behest of the other body we remove these important provisions from a piece of legislation passed at the end of the last session of congress . incrementalism in wartime is unacceptable . there is a clear and present danger . we must respond . pass the rule . pass the sessions amendment . pass the underlying legislation . let us preserve and protect our union and our way of life . ",R
"mr. speaker , i thank the chairman for this time . i rise in strong support of this conference report as the people 's house at long last takes care of some unfinished business . in the closing days of the 108th congress , some in the other body objected to commonsense provisions that deal with our national security and our border security , to wit , the notion that when you apply for a driver 's license or another legal document , you should be who you say you are , and you should enjoy legal status in this country . this supplemental conference report includes the real id act , and at long last the congress of the united states gets real and understands that border security and national security are one and the same . pass this to help protect our borders and help protect our national security . ",R
"mr. chairman , i rise to express my strong support of h.r. 418 . chairman sensenbrenner has presented for the consideration of the house a commonsense bill that will disrupt travel of would-be terrorists who would seek to do us harm right here in america . when enacted , these provisions will be yet another set of effective tools to help prevent another september 11-type attack . all of these provisions are derived from provisions of the house-passed version of h.r. 10 , the 9-11 recommendations implementation act of 2004 . during the conference with the other body on what became the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 , the provisions contained in h.r. 418 were either dropped in their entirety or modified so substantially as to virtually defeat the fundamental purpose of the provision . a majority of the conferees on the part of the house very reluctantly agreed in order to get a conference agreement on the fundamental reform of the nation 's intelligence community . we are all original cosponsors of h.r. 418 . as chairman of the conference , i thought that these provisions made sense then and they make sense now and should be enacted . the core provisions of h.r. 418 establish a set of fundamental standards that state-issued identification cards , including driver 's license , must meet to be recognized for federal identification purposes , such as entering a federal building . the bill provides the various states with 3 years to make any necessary modifications to their identification cards , if they so chose . the bill provides the secretary of homeland security with discretion to extend the deadline for good cause upon application by an individual state . the bill does not impede the authority of individual states to determine who may operate a motor vehicle or who may be issued a state personal identification card for non-federal purposes . some argue that the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 already addresses this issue adequately . i simply disagree . the enacted provision requires a negotiated rulemaking process , without any absolute certitude that the negotiations on the proposed consensus regulations will be concluded by the date specified in the act . no hard date for implementation of these fundamental standards is specified . h.r. 418 also restores the authority of an immigration judge to make a determination whether to grant or deny an individual application for asylum . at its core , the provision makes explicit the judge 's authority to assess the creditability of the assertions of oppression being made by the applicant , just as judges and juries do each day with respect to criminal defendants . as some assert , h.r. 418 does not require the asylum applicant to produce documentary evidence in order to be granted asylum . it grants an immigration judge the authority to request the applicant to provide evidence to support the applicant 's oral testimony and that of witnesses ' supporting the applicant . h.r. 418 clearly states that the applicant is not required to provide documentary evidence if `` the applicant does not have the evidence or can not obtain the evidence without departing the united states. '' h.r. 418 includes a provision specifying that offenses which currently provide grounds to deny a would-be terrorist entry into the united states are also grounds for the deportation of such persons , if they have somehow managed to enter the country illegally . today , that is not the case . this glaring gap in the law must be closed . finally , h.r. 418 provides the secretary of homeland security with authority to waive environmental laws , so that the border fence running 14 miles east from the pacific ocean at san diego may finally be completed . authorized by congress in 1996 , it has yet to be completed because of on-going environmental litigation . it is time to complete this much needed barrier to help secure one of the most used corridors for illegal entry , which is adjacent to the numerous facilities of the united states navy and marine corps in san diego . mr. chairman , i commend chairman sensenbrenner for his leadership and urge my colleagues to support h.r. 418 . ",R
"mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to h.r. 418 , the real id act . this legislation was crafted under the guise of protecting our borders and improving homeland security . however , it would make it more difficult for victims of persecution to obtain asylum impose expensive mandates on the states , and authorize the secretary of homeland security to waive any and all laws to construct barriers at our international borders -- none of which will make this country any safer from terrorists . this legislation would also effectively undo the important immigration and security reforms passed by the 108th congress , putting us at greater risk for future attacks . the 9/11 commission 's immigration-related recommendations focused on targeting terrorist travel through reliable identification systems and effective , integrated information sharing . instead , this legislation seeks to change immigration laws broadly and in ways unrelated to essential intelligence reform . this legislation would expand the authority for expedited alien removal without further hearing or review , impose stringent restrictions on asylum seekers hoping to be given an interview with an asylum officer , and require unreasonable standards of proof for aliens seeking asylum . none of the 9/11 hijackers sought or were granted asylum ; rather , they were granted legal visas to enter the united states using fraudulent documents overseas . furthermore , current law explicitly bars terrorists or members of terrorist organizations from gaining asylum , and asylum-seekers already undergo thorough background checks through the fbi , cia , department of homeland security , and department of state databases . the onerous restrictions offered by h.r. 418 would keep highly-vulnerable victims of heinous crimes from escaping their persecutors , and they do not address the real vulnerabilities in our immigration system . a report released this week by the united states commission on international religious freedom underscores the dangerous impact these so-called reforms would have on our asylum process . according to the commission , the current expedited removal process in the u.s. places victims of persecution at great risk for further trauma , while the severity of conditions and deprivation imposed on asylum seekers was `` shocking. '' rather than address this serious situation in the ways recommended by the commission , today this congress would force even more innocent asylum seekers into expedited removal or send them back to their persecutors without an opportunity to appeal their case to an immigration judge . h.r. 418 would also impose statutory requirements for state-issued driver 's licenses and repeal the important identification security measures enacted by the bipartisan intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act . rather than permit local , state , and federal officials to work together to create minimum security standards for driver 's licenses and identification cards as authorized by congress last year , h.r. 418 would mandate statutory standards for states and require them to share personal information on all licensed drivers in a massive national database . h.r. 418 would dismantle the carefully crafted immigration and security reforms enacted by congress last year in the intelligence reform bill . that law will toughen our border security by adding 10 , 000 new border patrol agents over the next 5 years , strengthening visa application requirements , and adding 4 , 000 new immigration and customs investigators . it fortifies identification security while allowing the state officials charged with making those changes to be a part of the process . mr. chairman , this law implemented key 9/11 commission recommendations without jeopardizing our legal immigration system or the ability of legitimate asylum seekers to escape persecution . our country was founded on the principle of immigration , and we must not close our doors to those who lawfully seek to share in the freedom and democracy that americans have always held dear . the congress must do everything in its power to protect our citizens and our borders . h.r. 418 , however , does not achieve those important goals , and i urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation . ",D
"i am , mr. speaker , in its present form . ",D
"mr. speaker , i rise today to offer a motion to recommit that would provide $ 100 million in health and $ 50 million in job training transitional assistance to help active duty forces make the transition to the veterans benefits system . the gentleman from washington ( mr. baird ) xz4000110 and i have been working on this issue together and trying to add $ 1.3 billion for va health care and reintegration services . while our amendment was ruled not in order , we now have a chance to ensure that this supplemental includes at least some funding for vital health and employment services . america is currently asking more of its all-volunteer military force than it ever has before . yet even as america prepares to continue its large and prolonged military campaign in iraq , it has done very little to provide for the veterans of this war . our obligation to support our troops does not end when they leave iraq . but how are we supposed to provide adequate health care to these new veterans when we did not even meet the needs of our current veterans ? the fiscal year 2005 omnibus was $ 1.3 billion short in the amount that then secretary principi , as well as the house committee on veterans ' affairs , stated was needed to just maintain the current level of veterans health care . we also need to make sure that our returning soldiers have the readjustment assistance they need , particularly for members of the guard and reserve . you have to understand , these members do not go back to a base , they go back to their home state and then are scattered throughout that state . members of the national guard returning home face immense challenges in transitioning out of active duty deployment and back to civilian life . while the state guard offices are working to provide these returning soldiers with important information regarding their health care , employment assistance and other transitional services , they simply do not have the money they need to complete the education and counseling necessary for a smooth transition back to civilian life . i think our returning soldiers deserve better . mr. speaker , i urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit and keep our promise to our nation 's veterans . mr. speaker , i yield to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 . ",D
"mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 418 , the real id act . the real id act incorporates four of the 9/11 commission recommendations that are necessary to effectively protect our constituents from terrorists seeking to exploit loopholes in our immigration system . this bill will close several of those dangerous loopholes . in addition to providing important federal security guidelines for driver 's licenses , the real id act also includes other important homeland security measures , including the deportability of terrorists , preventing terrorists from gaming the asylum system , and implementing border security measures in san diego . currently , the terrorists and their supporters can be kept out of the united states ; but as soon as they set foot into the u.s. on tourist visas , we can not deport them for many of the very same offenses . this hinders our ability to protect americans from those alien terrorists who have infiltrated the united states . h.r. 418 makes aliens deportable for the same terrorist-related offenses as those that would prevent them from being admitted to the united states in the first place . another deficiency in current law is based on a flawed understanding of how terrorist organizations operate . the immigration and nationality act now reads that if an alien provides funding or other material support to a terrorist organization , the alien can escape deportation if they can show that he did not know that the funds or support would further the organization 's terrorist activity ; i.e. , his donation did not immediately go to buying explosives . as kenneth mckune , former associate coordinator for counterterrorism at the state department , explained , `` given the purposes , organizational structure , and clandestine nature of foreign terrorist organizations , it is highly likely that any material support to these organizations will ultimately inure to the benefit of their criminal , terrorist functions , regardless of whether such support was ostensibly intended to support nonviolent , nonterrorist activities. '' money given to terrorist organizations is fungible . senator diane feinstein has rightly stated that `` i simply do not accept that so-called humanitarian works by terrorist groups can be kept separate from their other operations . i think the money will ultimately go to bombs and bullets rather than babies , or , because money is fungible , it will free up other funds to be used on terrorist activities. '' the real id act is written so that an alien who provides funds or other material support to a terrorist organization would be deportable unless he did not know and should not reasonably have known that the organization was a terrorist organization . mr. chairman , i urge the support and passage of h.r. 418 . ",R
"mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to this amendment . the asylum provisions in h.r. 418 are vitally important to protect our constituents from child molesters , rapists , murderers , and other criminals , as well as terrorists seeking asylum in our country . i believe that we must keep the asylum open and honest for those who have a good-faith claim to asylum . however , we must also protect our constituents from aliens who seek to abuse our asylum processes and do harm to our citizens . for instance , because he was free after applying for asylum , mir aimal kansi was able to murder two cia employees at cia headquarters . ramzi yousef took advantage of the freedom he gained by applying for asylum to mastermind the first world trade center attack which killed six and injured 1 , 000 in the amendment author 's district . the asylum provisions in h.r. 418 do not prevent aliens from seeking asylum . those who truly have been persecuted for religious or political grounds will be allowed to present their cases just as they are able to now . these provisions merely overturn ninth circuit court decisions saying that immigration judges can not use inconsistencies in an alien 's statement to determine if he or she is being untruthful . the bill also says that an asylum applicant may be asked to corroborate his claim with evidence , if such evidence can be obtained without leaving the united states . one of the goals of this bill is to ensure that our asylum system is consistent with our judicial system . if a judge or criminal jury can sentence a criminal defendant to life in prison or even execution because they did not believe the defendant 's story , certainly an immigration judge can deny an asylum claim to an alien for the same basis . when an american goes to court to settle a dispute , he bears the burden of proof to prove his claim . requiring the asylum claimant to bear the burden of proof is consistent , both with our justice system and with international law . permitting the judge to require an asylum claimant to produce corroborating evidence he has or can obtain without leaving the united states is just common sense . if a claimant says , for example , that he fled his country because he received a threatening letter from a government official , the judge would be remiss if he failed to ask to see the letter or at least inquire about what happened to the letter . the asylum protections in the real id act are vitally important to ensuring the honesty of the asylum system , as well as the security of our nation and its citizens . i urge my colleagues to support the underlying bill , h.r. 418 , and oppose this amendment .

"mr. speaker , i take this time for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come . ",D
"mr. speaker , i would be pleased to yield to my friend , the gentleman from texas , the majority leader , for the purposes of informing us of the schedule . ",D
"mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i thank the gentleman for the schedule . with reference to the real id bill , mr. leader , can you tell us at this point in time the type of rule that that will be considered under ; and , in particular , what amendments , not necessarily specific amendments , but whether amendments will be allowed , motions to recommit , and items of that nature . ",D
"mr. speaker , reclaiming my time once again , i presume the gentleman is talking about merged at some later date . obviously , the must-pass bill would not be available next week . am i correct ? ",D
so the gentleman is talking about merging it at some time in the future after passage ? ,D
"mr. leader , with respect to the energy bill , it is my understanding that there is some discussion that the energy bill may proceed not next week but the week following . can you tell me whether that is a reasonable possibility , or probability ? ",D
"mr. leader , i might say that i think all of us understand the importance of energy legislation . all of us understand the necessity to become energy independent . i would suggest , in that framework , that i think personally that we can pass an energy bill . obviously , there are some items that are in the energy bill or that are proposed for the energy bill that have significant opposition on one side of the aisle or the other . i would hope , mr. leader , if we could , in working with the various committee chairs , and i suppose most primarily the gentleman from texas ( mr. barton ) xz4000180 and the gentleman from michigan ( mr. dingell ) xz4001100 in this respect , to come to as bipartisan an agreement on the substance of that bill so that we could see it not just pass through the house of representatives , which may be interesting in terms of the political claim that we passed it , but which does nothing for our energy independence , which is , i think , our objective . so i would hope that we could deal with this in as bipartisan a fashion as possible so that when we send it to the other body that we may have more success there , more success out of conference , and send a bill to the president that will facilitate both energy independence and the effective and efficient discovery , development , and delivery at retail to the consumer of energy options . i do not know whether you want to say anything . ",D
"mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for referencing the committee on ways and means , but i certainly agree with him that having the gentleman from california ( mr. thomas ) xz4004010 and the gentleman from new york ( mr. rangel ) xz4003330 work closely together , and perhaps their respective chairs of the subcommittees that might deal with that work together , would be very , very useful to accomplishing an objective as opposed to simply passing a bill that then languishes in the congress and never gets to the president . if , in fact , we consider that , and it sounds to me like we certainly do not have enough information to determine whether or not the week after next the energy bill might be on the floor , but if and when it comes to the floor , mr. leader , would you contemplate the possibility of having an open rule on that piece of legislation , given its importance and scope ? i am happy to yield to the gentleman for a response , mr. speaker . ",D
"mr. speaker , i would hope on that bill , because of its great importance to the security of the nation and to all of our consumers of energy , which is to say all of us , that we would have as broad a consideration of it as possible so that we could get everybody 's ideas put on the floor , voted up or down , and move the bill with as big a consensus as we can accomplish . mr. speaker , i thank the majority leader . ",D
"mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from wisconsin , and i thank our new chairman and congratulate him on his new position . mr. chairman , i intend to vote for this supplemental appropriations bill , because i believe it is imperative to support our men and women in harm 's way in iraq and afghanistan and to continue our nation 's important work there . our nation must finish what it has begun . we can not disregard the bravery of millions of iraqi citizens who turned out to vote in january . failure there , in my opinion , is not and should not be an option . this legislation also is a recognition of the bravery and courage of our service men and women , more than 1 , 500 of whom have given the ultimate measure of sacrifice for freedom . as tom friedman pointed out in the new york times in february : `` there is no single action we could undertake anywhere in the world to reduce the threat of terrorism that would have a bigger impact today than a decent outcome in iraq. '' i share that view . mr. chairman , i believe it is more than mere coincidence that over the last several months the winds of democratic reform have begun to blow , not only in iraq and afghanistan but also in lebanon , egypt , saudi arabia , and the palestinian authority . but we must harbor no illusions about the prospects for democratic reform in lands that have never known it . however , i believe that it is in our nation 's interests to encourage and promote it . mr. chairman , i also want to note that this legislation includes funding for food and humanitarian assistance in sudan , as well as tsunami relief . however , despite these important funding requests , i would be remiss if i did not point out that this bill is far from perfect . in many respects it is troubling . this congress has a constitutional obligation , a duty , on behalf of the voters who elected us to serve here to hold the administration accountable for such expenditures . we have asked for a report . we have not gotten that report yet . the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr. murtha ) xz4002860 mentioned that in our markup . the gentleman from california ( mr. lewis ) xz4002391 mentioned that in our markup . the american public wants to support this effort but wants to do so in an effective , honest and efficient manner . it is our responsibility to ensure that . it is clear that the administration has included many measures in addition that are not emergencies . we understand that practice . it has happened before . but i believe with all due respect that we have not met our oversight requirements . this bill is approximately $ 82 billion . in talking to staff , and maybe i stand to be corrected , but i believe that there are only two appropriations bills , defense and labor and health that are larger than this $ 82 billion bill . now there may be another one . i think va-hud used to be but we do not have va-hud . what does that mean ? that means we are passing the third largest appropriations bill that we will pass in the congress . what does that mean ? we are passing the third largest appropriations bill through this house without a single hearing , not one . there was no hearing in subcommittee , any of the subcommittees . there was no hearing in the full committee . we had 2 1/2 hours of consideration in the full committee . mr. chairman , as you know , we literally hold hundreds , perhaps thousands of hours of hearings on the individual bills . as a result , individual members have the opportunity to ask questions , to make sure themselves that the money that is asked for is being spent appropriately . as i said , i will support this bill . i do not hold our new chairman responsible for this . this is a supplemental . it came down relatively late . our men and women are at risk . we need to get this money moving . i understand that . but i suggest to my colleagues that oversight is critical , and i would urge the gentleman from california ( mr. lewis ) xz4002391 and the ranking member , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 , that as we proceed with further consideration of these items that we exercise oversight carefully in the coming months to assure ourselves that this money is being spent as we intend it to be . mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me time . ",D
"mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . mr. speaker , i am of course going to vote for this emergency supplemental appropriation because i believe it is absolutely imperative to support our brave men and women in harm 's way in afghanistan and iraq . i know that even today , 2 years after the onset of operation iraqi freedom , there continues to be strong disagreement across the nation on the decision to remove the brutal hussein regime as well as the planning and prosecution of our military effort in iraq . however , on this point , i believe there is unanimity . we , the elected representatives of the american people , have a legislative duty as well as a moral responsibility , to do everything in our power to ensure that our troops have everything they need to defeat the vicious insurgency in iraq , to assist the iraqi people in establishing democracy , and continuing our efforts in afghanistan . in my view , however , we are not doing enough . just last week , the new york times reported the experience of marine company e , an experience that , `` was punctuated not only by a lack of armor , but also by a shortage of men and planning that further hampered their efforts in the battle. '' i am pleased , mr. speaker , that this bill includes $ 1.4 billion more than the administration requested for bolstering force protection needs such as add-on armor and night vision goggles , and , in addition , for outfitting troops rotating into iraq and afghanistan . over the last 4 years , this administration , however , has refused to ask the american people , particularly the wealthiest american people , to make even minimal sacrifices , while we ask our men and women in afghanistan and iraq for some to make the ultimate sacrifice . the very least , in my opinion , that we can do is give them the resources they need to achieve victory and to return home safely . i also support , mr. speaker , the important funding in this bill for tsunami relief , foreign assistance , and domestic homeland security as well as the $ 200 million in assistance for the palestinian authority for infrastructure and economic development projects . those are all worthwhile , necessary , and important projects . the political reforms taking place in the territories must be accompanied by an end to the poverty and lack of opportunity facing the palestinian people . that is ultimately how we will defeat terrorism . finally , however , let me raise , mr. speaker , one objection , among others , to the funding bill : the $ 592 million for a new embassy compound in baghdad . that is not an emergency . this funding , mr. speaker , is not only inappropriate in this emergency supplemental appropriation , but it also , in my opinion , is substantially excessive in its expenditures ; not to keep the people safe , we can do that , but to create an embassy in a relatively small country that , hopefully , in the years ahead , will be more peaceful than we have found it . mr. speaker , i believe that we are at a critical juncture in iraq . victory is imperative , although it is not certain . i urge my colleagues to support this conference report . ",D
"mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me the time . we started this fence about 20 years ago . we started it by building the first steel fence across that 14-mile segment between the coastal hills of san diego county and the pacific ocean . we did that because drug trucks were running that border at the rate of about 300 per month . we had about 10 people being murdered each year , along with numerous robberies and rapes , to such a high degree that the best-selling book , `` lines and shadows '' by joseph wambaugh , was written depicting this `` no man 's land , '' where nobody wanted to be after dark . so we built that first line , which was the steel fence right on the border . we then built the second fence , that is , the second tier of the so-called triple fence , after we passed a law signed by president bill clinton in 1996 . and it was president clinton who signed the bill waiving the endangered species act and waiving nepa because he thought it was so important that we have security at this , the most porous smugglers ' corridor in the united states of america . now , i can just tell you , as a guy who has worked on this thing from the start , my staff went out and found those 79 , 000 steel landing mats to build this fence . if the extremists had discovered this fence before we got the first 12 miles built , that would not be built . we stopped those 300 drug trucks a month , stopped them dead . we eliminated the 10 murders a year , mostly of undocumented workers . we eliminated the hundreds of rapes of the people who were coming through there because we built that fence . if the extremists had had their way , they would have gone to a sympathetic federal court , tied us up in lawsuits and we would not have had the fence . the secretary of the navy has written us a letter saying that completion of this project will enhance the security of our naval installations by reducing the potential threat environment created by an unsecured border . a few miles north of this gap in the fence is the biggest naval installation on the west coast . through this gap have come and been apprehended people from nations that sponsor terrorists , nations like north korea , nations like syria . this is a security issue . and for people to say this is an environmental issue , this is the state of play right now , all these trails you see have been hammered into that ecosystem by the smugglers . none of my colleagues have been out there trying to stop them . they have hammered these trails by the hundreds into the ecosystem , hammered it into the marshlands and the estuary lands . good biologists say it will take hundreds of years for these areas to be restored , not by actions of the border patrol or by our security apparatus , but by the smugglers who come across this particular gap in the fence . we need to secure this gap . the secretary of the navy recognizes that , president clinton recognized that and gave an unprecedented waiver . we need to complete the border fence .

"mr. speaker , i rise in support of the conference agreement . i wish to commend the conferees for their work in bringing this important legislation to the house floor . not only does this bill provide critical support to our military and the war on terror , but it also funds international humanitarian reconstruction and economic assistance programs provided by the united states agency for international development . as my colleagues know , i have believed for many years that the hiv/aids pandemic represents one of the greatest health and moral crises of our time , particularly in africa . that is why i was especially pleased by the president 's announcement of a visionary emergency plan for aids relief , and have supported grants and other programs funded by usaid that help to reverse the spread of this pandemic . it is thus my strongly held view that usaid should continue to fund existing programs , as well as invest in new programs , that support the president 's hiv/aids initiative . in this regard , there are two programs , both directed toward south africa , that i believe deserve the agency 's particular attention . the first program is the new african center for aids management , which has , to date , trained over 800 graduates and is the largest program of its kind worldwide . i understand that usaid has provided only modest funding to support this initiative , while the bulk of the support has come from south african institutions . with substantial additional support from usaid during fiscal years 2005 and 2006 , this program could double in size and provide training for executives and senior managers from government , the provinces , municipalities and educational institutions , as well as ngos , corporations , and trade unions , in the management of an expanded capability to detect and treat hiv/aids in africa . the second program would be a new joint u.s.-south african program to provide telemedicine-equipped mobile clinics to serve the south african military involved in peacekeeping efforts throughout africa . this program , which merits both usaid and dod support , would be run through the south africa medical research council and provide medical services to remote areas to combat hiv/aids and other infectious diseases . this mobile clinic system , employing some of the latest u.s. telemedicine technologies , would leverage u.s. military expertise across distances . as this system develops , so would it expand in both its capabilities and its services to the civilian population . both of these programs are examples of humanitarian initiatives requiring modest investments that usaid is both equipped and funded to support . i applaud the agency 's past work in this area , and encourage both the continuation of existing efforts and the expansion of the new efforts that i have outlined . ",R
"mr. chairman , i move to strike the requisite number of words . mr. chairman , i rise today in strong support of this amendment that aims to commit $ 3 million to the united nations population fund ( unfpa ) . the unfpa has asked its donor countries for about $ 28 million for women who were victims of the tsunami . the money in this amendment is about 11 percent of what they are asking for . in january , i visited areas devastated by the tsunami . i visited what was left of a three-story maternity hospital . three hundred women and infants were located here when the first wave hit . the rush of water toppled a high cement fence , knocked down utility polls like toothpicks , and shattered all of the glass windows in the front facade . of the 300 women and their babies , all but one -- a newborn -- was saved from the crashing waves . we met with one doctor who finished a c-section -- in absolute darkness , after the generators were underwater , as the rest of the building was evacuated . the hospital was practically destroyed . the beds were pushed and piled against each other by the flooding , and shards of glass crunched under our feet . the sheets were strewn about like wet rags , and saturated packages of medicine were thrown in useless piles . natural disasters are particularly harsh on pregnant women . the loss of medical care and its infrastructure is compounded by malnutrition , disease and the trauma of the disaster . these issues can cause miscarriage or early labor , which both require medical care that is unavailable . the result can be maternal death . the situation that women face in the areas is dire . the indonesian midwife association has also reported that 1 , 650 of their 5 , 500 members , that is about 30 percent of their members , died in the tsunami . many of the surviving midwives are picking up the pieces of their own lives and dealing with their personal loss . reestablishing maternal health services will be a main use of this money , which is of great concern to the region . there are 150 , 000 pregnant women in the tsunami-affected areas -- 50 , 000 are scheduled to give birth in the next three months . they need personal hygiene kits in refugee camps ; and safe-birthing kits in hospitals , clinics and health centers . they need soap and sterile cotton cloth , antibiotics , emergency obstetric equipment , and drugs for treating sexually transmitted infections . relief efforts often overlook these supplies , and the unfpa is uniquely prepared to provide them . the unfpa has experience working with women in disaster areas : they have participated in emergency projects in more than 50 countries and territories . they already have offices in tsunami-affected countries , and they understand the distinctive ways that disasters affect women and children . women are more vulnerable to sexual assaults during times of disaster . women who are pregnant , nursing , or caring for small children do not have the capacity to stand in line for long periods of time for supplies . the funds in this amendment are intended to be used by the unfpa to help women in these circumstances by : providing tools and medicines needed for safe childbirth ; preventing and treating sexual assault ; promoting access to clean water , food and healthcare ; providing sanitary supplies ; and providing psycho-social counseling . the tsunami devastated an entire region , and i am glad that this congress is appropriating funds to help address the many issues that the people in region now face . it is my hope that my colleagues will vote for this amendment , which will help some of the most vulnerable of the region . ",D
"mr. speaker , i rise to question the omission of an amendment sponsored by mrs. maloney , ms. sanchez , mr. crowley and myself , which was agreed to by the chairman of appropriations . the amendment took $ 3 million from the `` economic support fund '' and put it toward the `` tsunami recovery and reconstruction fund , '' for the express purpose of the providing the united nations population fund , unfpa with these funds . this past january , i toured the region that was overwhelmed by the tsunami . the extent of the destruction was massive , and i was glad to see the world contributing to relief efforts . however , i was concerned that the special needs of women were not being adequately addressed . i visited the remains of a three-story maternity hospital . there were 300 women and infants in that hospital when the first wave hit . the tsunami toppled a cement wall , flattened utility polls , and shattered all of the glass windows in the front of the building . of the 300 women and their babies , all but one , a newborn , were saved from the crashing waves . i met a doctor who finished a c-section in absolute darkness , after the generators were underwater , as the rest of the building was evacuated . the hospital was practically destroyed . the beds were pushed and piled against each other by the flooding , and shards of glass crunched under our feet . the sheets were strewn about like wet rags , and saturated packages of medicine were thrown in useless piles . it is conditions like these that the unfpa addresses . the organization has experience working with women in disaster areas ; they have participated in emergency projects in more than 50 countries and territories . they already have offices in tsunami-affected countries , and they understand the distinctive ways that disasters affect women and children . when i visited in january , there were an estimated 150 , 000 pregnant women in the tsunami-affected areas . the unfpa has worked to supply safe-birthing kits and emergency obstetric equipment . women who are in refugee camps need personal hygiene kits , soap , sterile cotton cloth , antibiotics , and drugs for treating sexually transmitted infections . although relief efforts often overlook these supplies , and the unfpa has done its best to fulfill these needs . unfpa 's priorities are reproductive health , including safe childbirth , prevention of violence against women and girls , and counseling for those affected by the 26 december tsunami . for many of these women , they must now become the head of the household . they have become widows overnight , and must deal with the emotional and economic issues involved with being the sole breadwinner in an area with no jobs . in early january , unfpa asked for $ 28 million to support its tsunami-related work . our amendment would have given them $ 3 million , which is about 11 percent of what they requested . by late february , over 70 percent of the requested funding had been received or pledged . germany gave $ 8 million . japan gave $ 5.5 million . the netherlands gave $ 1.5 million . norway gave $ 1 million . new zealand gave $ 700 , 000 . the united states has not given anything to this organization that is the most experienced and successful in addressing the distinctive needs of women during times of natural disaster . but this is not unusual . we have not given the unfpa the money they need for some time . the omnibus for 2005 earmarked $ 34 million for unfpa , however , the unfpa has not and will not receive it . the unfpa also received no funds from the united states in 2002 , 2003 , and 2004 . unfortunately , the president will not release these funds to this organization , because of issues related to abortion . the money would not have been used for abortion . the money would have helped women deliver their babies . it would have helped women who have been sexually assaulted . it would have given women some of the tools they need to take care of themselves and their children . it is unconscionable that this congress would not allocate this $ 3 million to unfpa . ",D
"mr. chairman , i rise today in strong support of h.r. 418 , the real id act of 2005 . this bill includes provisions that are essential to preventing terrorists and other criminals from obtaining fraudulent identification and provides security at our borders . last year , congress passed legislation based on the recommendations of the 9/11 commission but failed to address vital national security and homeland security issues . this legislation addresses theses issues and further secures our nation in a post 9/11 world . h.r. 418 requires states to implement new minimum regulations for state drivers ' license and identification document security standards that must be met within 3 years . it also establishes a process to enable states to use an existing department of transportation communication system to confirm that drivers ' licenses presented are genuine and validly issued to the person who is carrying them . the 19 terrorists who attacked america on 9/11 had obtained over 63 valid forms of identification between them to breach our homeland security . improving document security is necessary to counter threats from foreign terrorism . this legislation also takes important steps regarding asylum reform . it prevents terrorists and scam artists from abusing our asylum system and gives immigration judges the tools they need to undercut asylum fraud before it happens . most importantly , h.r. 418 is critical to the continued construction of the southwest border fence in san diego . despite efforts by the federal government and the border patrol , california 's coastal commission has objected to and stopped the final phase of fence construction . completion of the fence will reduce the number of illegal crossings , and will allow the border patrol to re-deploy manpower and resources to other problem areas in san diego . completion of the 3-mile gap in the fence , known as `` smugglers gulch , '' would be a strong step toward securing our border . mr. chairman , i made a promise to my constituents to continue to fight for security enhancements to curb illegal immigration and secure our borders . this legislation is essential to national security and i urge my colleagues to vote in support of h.r. 418 . ",R
"mr. chairman , i offer two amendments and ask unanimous consent they be considered en bloc . ",D
"mr. chairman , my amendment is very simple . it adds $ 50 million for disaster assistance and $ 50 million for refugee assistance in sudan and other african countries . if this amendment passes , the house product would still be $ 550 million below the president 's request . so for colleagues that argue we are spending too much money , this amendment is fiscally prudent . but more importantly , adopting this amendment is quite frankly the right thing to do . mr. chairman , my amendment could be the most decent , moral and effective $ 100 million spent in this bill . this $ 100 million in disaster relief and refugee assistance would go very far in alleviating the multiple disasters and refugee crisis in africa . most of africa 's urgent humanitarian needs are shockingly affordable . sadly , what we have been missing is the political will to stand up and do something . mr. chairman , the president speaks often about ending evil , about reaching into your heart and doing the right thing . the number of deaths , over 1 , 300 a day in sudan and the democratic republic of the congo , that could be prevented would truly be ending evil and we know this is the right thing to do . mr. chairman , the only way for evil to succeed is for good people to do nothing . i urge a `` yea '' vote on the jackson amendment .

"mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent to strike the requisite number of words . ",D
"mr. speaker , i raise a point of order . ",D
"mr. speaker , pursuant to section 426 of the congressional budget act of 1974 , i make a point of order against consideration of the rule , h. res. 71 . line 10 on page 2 of h. res. 71 states , `` all points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. '' the rule makes in order h.r. 418 , the real id act of 2005 , which contains a large unfunded mandate on state governments in violation of section 425 of the budget act . section 426 of the budget act specifically states that the rules committee may not waive section 425 , and therefore this rule violates section 426 . ",D
"mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . section 425 of the budget act states that a point of order lies against legislation which imposes an underfunded mandate against state or local governments more than 62 million per year over 5 years . at the very least , mr. speaker , we have before us today an unfunded mandate that will cost state governments between $ 660 million and $ 780 million over the next 5 years alone . it has come to my attention that the national governors association is opposed to this legislation for that very fact . specifically , subparagraphs b , c , d , and e of section 202 of h.r. 418 requires state governments to comply with new federal driver 's license requirements and to verify and store additional personal identification records , which the congressional budget office , cbo , in its latest estimate projects to cost $ 120 million over the next 5 years , but last estimated costs states $ 240 million over 5 years . there have been no substantive changes since last year 's to imply that this bill would not cost the states at least $ 240 million as estimated by the last congress . the above sections also require states to participate in an interstate database to share driver information , which cbo estimates will cost an additional $ 80 million over 3 years . in addition , by necessary implication , the bill would require states to develop new standards for the issuance of birth and death certificates which cbo has estimated would cost states $ 460 million over the next 5 years . there is overwhelming evidence before us today that this bill , which has bypassed the committee process , denies members the opportunity to hear expert testimony on the impact of these sweeping changes or to determine alternatives to ensure that all of us are on the same page in the war against terrorism . the opportunity to determine changes to current law or to offer amendments to the proposed legislation was not given to us , and it will impose overwhelming costs on state governments already struggling to meet the growing costs of local law enforcement 's role in securing the homeland . even further , this bill was drafted without any input from the governors and state legislatures and even excludes the states from the standard-setting process despite states ' historic roles as the issuers of driver 's licenses and other identification data . we must be in partnership with our states if we are going to have a real war against terror in the united states . for these reasons , the nationals governors association , as i indicated ; the american association of motor vehicle administrators ; and the national conference of state legislatures all strongly oppose this legislation in its present form . in a letter issued yesterday , the national governors association , american association of motor vehicle administrators say that they are in opposition to the driver 's license provision in both h.r. 418 and h.r. 368 , stating the costs of implementing such standards and verification procedures for the 220 million driver 's licenses by states represents a massive unfunded mandate . this does not say that in a bipartisan manner reasoned out through committee process done very quickly that some addressing of this question can not be properly answered . the national conference of state legislatures also has voiced strong opposition , stating that ncsl is opposed to any further federal attempts including coercion or direct preemption to usurp state authority over the driver 's license process or diminish the validity or usefulness of licenses awarded at the state level . ncsl urges the federal government to respect the provisions and intent of the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 . what we have here today is an assault on federalism in the legislative process . the point of order is not about whether one agrees or disagree with the sweeping policy changes of the real id act . this point of order is about the farce before us that has trampled states ' rights and inflated the burden on our local governments without their input . i urge members to vote `` no '' on consideration of the resolution and stand up for the rights of their home states ' legislature , governor , and local governments , along with the people of the united states . mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . ",D
"mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , distinguished ranking member of the full house committee on the judiciary . ",D
"mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . i thank my colleague from texas for his comments . i think i can start out by saying that we come from a state that is very diligent and as well very astute on their members of congress supporting unfunded mandates to a burdened and already overworked state budget in a growing state that would have added responsibilities with this enormous burden that this real id bill would exercise against it . let me just say to the gentleman from texas ( mr. sessions ) xz4003670 , because i know his commitment to fiscal responsibility , let me refer him back to the cbo report of 2004 . we appreciate the cbo , but we know what happened ; and i think it is more important to know what the impact will be on the states on the basis of the national governors association and state legislatures . in 2004 , on this very same bill , the cbo told what the numbers would be . it was not under $ 62 million . in fact , it was mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . ",D
"mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . mr. speaker , my good friend knows we all have the greatest respect for the cbo , but the cbo analyzes what they are given . i might invite my colleague to read the cbo estimate , which clearly states that this is going to cost more than is indicated by this rule and by the legislation . in fact , it is clear that in addition , by necessary implication , the bill would require states to develop new standards for the issuance of birth and death certificates , which cbo has estimated would cost states $ 460 billion over the next 5 years . i would venture to say the competents of the cbo could be put on the witness stand , and they would attest to the fact that this is what it was going to cost . so this is not in any way casting aspersions on their good work . it is what has been presented to them , and they have analyzed it . it is not an accurate picture , what has been presented to them this year , because they documented that this is a more than $ 450 million program . mr. speaker , this violates the rule , and it violates the waiver where , in essence , the republicans indicated in their early beginnings in the majority that they would not allow unfunded mandates to go forward on this floor . i joined them in that . i ask my colleagues to support this point of order , so we stand here united in a bipartisan way not to support an unfunded mandate . the actual merits of the bill , mr. speaker , can be discussed , as my colleague has said , later on during the day . we are discussing at this moment the value of this bill . it is excessive . it is burdensome . it is an unfunded mandate , and it might hamper our war against terrorism and the protection of our homeland . let us try to do this in a more effective way . mr. speaker , i raise my point of order , and ask my colleagues to support it . section 425 of the budget act states that a point of order lies against legislation which imposes an unfunded mandate against state or local governments more than $ 62 million per year over 5 years . at the very least we have before us today an unfunded mandate that will cost state governments between $ 660 million and $ 780 million over the next 5 years alone . specifically , subparagraphs ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) of section 202 of h.r. 418 require state governments to comply with new federal driver 's license requirements and to verify and store additional personal identification records , which the congressional budget office , cbo , in its latest estimate , projects to cost states $ 120 million over the next 5 years , but last year estimated cost states $ 240 million over 5 years . there have been no substantive changes since last year 's estimate to imply that this bill would not cost the states at least $ 240 million as estimated last congress . the above sections also require states to participate in an interstate database to share driver information , which cbo estimates will cost an additional $ 80 million over 3 years . in addition , by necessary implication , the bill would require states to develop new standards for the issuance of birth and death certificates , which cbo has estimated would cost states $ 460 million over the next 5 years . there is overwhelming evidence before us today that this bill -- which has bypassed the committee process , denying members the opportunity to hear expert testimony on the impact of these sweeping changes to current law or to offer amendments to the proposed legislation -- will impose overwhelming costs on state governments already struggling to meet the growing costs of local laws enforcement 's role in securing the homeland . even further , this bill was drafted without any input from governors and state legislatures and even excludes the states from the standard-setting process despite states ' historic roles as issuers of driver 's licenses and other identification data . for these reasons the national governors association , american association of motor vehicle administrators , and the national conferences of state legislatures all strongly oppose this legislation . in a letter issued yesterday the national governors association and the american association of motor vehicle administrators stated their opposition to the drivers license provisions in both h.r. 418 and h.r. 368 , stating : the cost of implementing such standards and verification procedures for the 220 million driver 's licenses by states represent a massive unfunded mandate the national conference of state legislatures also has voiced its strong opposition , stating that : ncsl is opposed to any further federal attempts including coersion or direct preemption , to usurp state authority over the driver 's license process or diminish the validity or usefulness of licenses awarded at the state level . ncsl urges the federal government to respect the provisions and intent of the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 . what we have before us today is an assault on federalism and the legislative process . this point of order is not about whether you agree or disagree with the sweeping policy changes of the real id act . this point of order is about the farce before us that has trampled states ' rights and inflated the burden on our local governments . i urge members to vote `` no '' on consideration of the resolution and stand up for the rights of your home states ' legislatures , governors and local governments . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . mr. chairman , i believe that what we do today is a matter that could have been approached in a bipartisan manner . as i look at the members on the floor of the house , each and every one is sincere in their commitment to the war on terrorism . and let me applaud them for that . i applaud the chairman of the full committee on the judiciary . let me applaud the ranking member . a number of members who are here on the floor are committee on the judiciary members . i want to applaud them for the work that has been done on this issue . that is why i believe that the real id act could have been addressed in regular order , the regular order of committee hearings , the regular order of taking testimony from governors and legislators and local government officials . but now the real id act is an attempt to breathe life into immigration provisions that were stripped from the terrorism reform and prevention act . these provisions were viewed as controversial then and they are no less controversial now . opposition to this legislation at this time is by no means a reflection on anyone 's commitment to the war on terrorism , but the real id act should have been subjected to hearings and markups before being brought to this floor . first of all , it is an unfunded mandate of almost $ 500 million . supporters of h.r. 418 are afraid that terrorists are using our asylum laws as a means of entering and remaining in the united states . this fear has to be put into perspective . terrorists are statutorily barred from asylum eligibility , and it is not apparent why they should choose such a complicated , time-consuming method for entering and remaining in the united states , in any event . in addition , large numbers of advocates , religious organizations and others who understand asylum laws and realize that there are still religious and political persecution today , realize that this bill is misdirected . as we stand here on the floor , the committee on rules is determining whether the nadler amendment will be admitted that responds to the crisis we face in the asylum laws if this bill is to be passed in its present form . we know that the 9/11 hijackers entered and remained in the united states as nonimmigrant visitors . visitor visas only require a 2-minute interview with an american consulate office . the applicant just has to establish that he will return to his country at the end of the authorized period of stay . this is much easier than the steps required for obtaining asylum . i too want to have a kind of organized system that bars terrorists , but putting into effect a national id card is not what the 9/11 commission said . in fact , they made it very clear . this legislation will force the united states in its national database and in its requirement standardizing id driver 's licenses and birth certificates which puts us on that road without hearings , without oversight , and without question of america 's civil liberties . i know that the polls and all the phone calls in members ' offices have said we do not want illegal aliens driving cars . well , do you want individuals on our highways and byways that are not licensed ? are you taking away the 10th amendment of the united states to allow them to be able to standardize those documents ? i do believe that we can standardize them by a biometric system , but we have intruded on the rights of states when they too can work with the federal government making the system work . i think there are valuable aspects of this bill ; not using certain id for certain federal purposes , which may in fact include travel . but the overbroadness of this particular legislation , barring any laws to be utilized in the building of a fence , eliminating environmental laws , work laws , criminal laws is overbroad . lastly , i would say , we are the land of the free and the brave . we have always welcomed those fleeing from persecution . this legislation bars that opportunity , and i would ask my colleagues to oppose it and for us to go back to the drawing board and work for freedom and the war against terrorism in a bipartisan way . mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .

"mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . mr. chairman , we are on the floor today because the representation has been made to the american people and to our colleagues that this legislation is legislation that relates and responds to the crisis in the war on terror . we all are united in that war , but this is an immigration bill , and i do believe we should do immigration in a bipartisan manner . let me make it very clear , the 9/11 terrorists would not have been thwarted by this legislation . in fact , all 19 of the 9/11 hijackers had documents to enter the country legally . and under this particular legislation , the terrorists would not have been prevented from using these documents to obtain driver 's licenses . i think the real crux is as was quoted in the words of governor jeb bush , `` what do you do with them ? `` illegal aliens who are working in our hotels and factories , who are working every day in our states and our cities and our counties ? the last thing , mr. chairman : do we remember bosnia and kosovo ? these were people seeking asylum . i think we have to judge ourselves by reason and reasonable policy . i join my colleagues in working together to secure the homeland , but in this instance , this does not follow the 9/11 recommendations . this commission did , in fact , say that they wanted secure documents , and identification should begin in the united states . it did not document or indicate in which manner we should be able to do that . i would have hoped that h.r. 620 , the security measures feasibility act , which would ask the hard questions of how and what is the best vehicle in order to be able to establish these secure documents , would have been the better approach . now we undermine the states ' ability for safety and security in their own states , and we undermine the very principles of this nation , which are to open the doors for those fleeing persecution both in terms of religious and political persecution . what about the cubans ? what about the haitians , the liberians , the sudanese , the bosnians ? what about those fleeing , as my colleague has indicated , our jewish individuals who were fleeing persecution ? i simply say that we have a better way of doing this . i wish we could do it together . i hope my colleagues will oppose this bill so we might do this effort in a bipartisan manner . mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to h.r. 418 , the real id act . the real id act is an attempt to breathe life into immigration provisions that were stripped from the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act . these provisions were viewed as controversial then , and they are no less controversial now . the real id act should have been subjected to hearings and markups before being brought to the floor . the supporters of the h.r. 418 are afraid that terrorists are using our asylum laws as a means of entering and remaining in the united states . this fear has to be put into perspective . terrorists are statutorily barred from asylum eligibility , and it is not apparent why they would choose such a complicated , time consuming method for entering and remaining in the united states in any event . the 9/11 hijackers entered and remained in the united states as nonimmigrant visitors . visitors ' visas only require a two-minute interview with an american consulate officer . the applicant just has to establish that he will return to his country at the end of the authorized period of stay . this is much easier than the steps required for obtaining asylum , which , among other things , require the applicant to establish a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social group , or political opinion . the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act established a study to find out the extent to which terrorists are attempting to use our asylum laws to enter and remain in the united states and what weaknesses they are exploiting . we need to wait for that information before we consider any bills on revising our asylum laws . changes should be designed to deal specifically with weaknesses that we know are being exploited . the approach in the real id act is to raise the bar on the burden of proof , which would result in a denial of relief to bona fide asylum seekers without any assurance that the changes would discourage terrorists from seeking asylum . for instance , in addition to showing that the alleged persecution would be `` on account of '' one of the enumerated grounds , the applicant would have to establish that the persecution was or will be `` a central reason for persecuting the applicant. '' in effect , the asylum applicant would have to establish what was in the mind of the persecutor . it is not apparent how this would discourage terrorists from fabricating asylum claims . the only certainty is that it would make it more difficult for bona fide asylum seekers to meet their burden of proof . the unfairness of this approach is illustrated by a comment that the honorable sandra day o'connor made recently about the asylum laws of our country . she said : the united states offers protection in the form of asylum to individuals fleeing persecution in other nations . in most cases , however , asylum seekers find themselves alone , destitute and facing deportation . asylum law is governed by a labyrinth of statutes , regulations , and case law , but , unlike criminal defendants , only those asylum seekers who can afford to hire an attorney or who are fortunate enough to secure pro bono counsel are represented . the real id act would codify the standards that adjudicators use in making credibility findings in asylum proceedings . the codification would encourage adverse credibility findings against asylum applicants who can not produce corroborating evidence of their account , or whose demeanor is inconsistent with an immigration judge 's preconceived expectations . this can be very unfair . people fleeing persecution often lack the opportunity and the ability to secure the legal evidence needed to corroborate their claims , and demeanor is a function in some cases of cultural background rather than credibility . for instance , it is considered rude in some cultures to stare into another person 's eyes during a conversation , but the failure to look someone in the eyes indicates deception in this country . the real id act also would expand the categories of people who can be excluded or deported as a terrorist . the broad net this would create would ensnare innocent people who have made donations or been involved in some other way with organizations they did not know were terrorist organizations . the defense to removal on that basis would be to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that you did not know , and should not reasonably have known , that the organization was a terrorist organization . this can be an impossible burden to meet . for instance , how would you prove by clear and convincing evidence that you did not notice a person who entered this room 5 minutes ago ? the real id act also includes sections on security measures for drivers ' licenses and identification cards . we have already enacted legislation to improve security measures for drivers ' licenses and identification cards . the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act we just enacted requires the secretary of transportation , in consultation with the secretary of homeland security , to promulgate regulations establishing minimum standards for driver 's licenses or personal identification cards issued by a state for use by federal agencies for identification purposes . before being published as proposed regulations , the standards would be subjected to a negotiated rule making committee that would include the affected stakeholders such as state elected officials and state motor vehicle departments . the recommendations of this committee are required to include an assessment of the benefits and the costs of the measures in the proposed regulations . in contrast , the real id act would impose specific requirements on the states now , without giving the states and the other stakeholders an opportunity to provide input on what these requirements should be , and without an assessment of the benefits and costs of the measures . if the security measures were to prove to be impossible or too costly to implement , it would require an act of congress to change them . before we can address the merits of the security measures that would be required by the real id act , we need answers to the following questions . ( 1 ) are the states capable of establishing and implementing the security measures mr. sensenbrenner is proposing ? for instance , his bill calls for two categories of drivers ' licenses , one for citizens and permanent residents and another for aliens who have nonimmigrant status . the licenses for nonimmigrants would be tied to periods of lawful status and extensions of the status . can the state motor vehicle departments handle this increased work load ? will the states be able to provide the training needed to evaluate the many immigration documents that reflect lawful nonimmigrant status ? ( 2 ) how much would it cost to establish , implement , and maintain these security measures ? we do not have unlimited the real id act also would restrict the privilege of obtaining a driver 's license to aliens who have lawful status . my security measures feasibility act would establish a study of the consequences that would result from forcing millions of undocumented aliens to drive without drivers ' licenses . sheriff timothy bukowski of kankakee , illinois , has made an important observation on this matter . according to sheriff bukowski , the issuance of drivers ' licenses is a safety issue , not an immigration issue . i agree with sheriff bukowski , a driver 's license is more than just a privilege to the driver , it also is a device that the states use to make our highways safer . austin assistant chief of police rudy landerso explains it this way . `` [ w ] e strongly believe it would be in the public interest to make available to these communities the ability to obtain a driver 's license . in allowing this community the opportunity to obtain driver 's licenses , they will have to study our laws and pass a driver 's test that will make them not only informed drivers but safe drivers. '' i would just add that it also requires them to have insurance . the real id act contains a provision that would provide the secretary of homeland security with authority to waive all laws he deems necessary for the expeditious construction of the barriers authorized to be constructed by section 102 of the illegal immigration reform and immigration responsibility act of 1996 , iirira . to my knowledge , a waiver this broad is unprecedented . it would waive all laws , including laws protecting civil rights ; laws protecting the health and safety of workers ; laws , such as the davis-bacon act , which are intended to ensure that construction workers on federally-funded projects are paid the prevailing wage ; environmental laws ; and laws respecting sacred burial grounds . it so broad that it would not just apply to i am concerned also by the piecemeal approach that the real id act is taking to immigration reform . we need comprehensive immigration reform , not fixes for a few specific problems . this view is shared by our colleagues on the senate side . senator john mccain has expressed the need to have comprehensive immigration reform . i have heard that he will be working on comprehensive immigration legislation with senator edward kennedy . we can do the same thing in the house of representatives . i invite my colleagues who are supporting the real id act to work with me on comprehensive immigration reform . in the meantime , however , passage of this piece-meal , ill-advised bill would be a step backwards . i urge you to vote against it . ",D
"mr. chairman , do i have time for a unanimous consent request ? ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . mr. chairman , let me first of all say and repeat what i have said many times , that immigration does not equate to terrorism . also i have said just recently , this morning , that the immigration reform question is a bipartisan question . i also took note of the fact that if one were to take polling numbers , there obviously is an overwhelming impression that what we are addressing today is an immigration bill . certainly the sessions amendment deals more with immigration than it does with straight issues of terrorism , because there is no divide amongst the american people regarding securing the homeland . my concern with this legislation is procedural , but it is also a question of fairness . this is a serious departure from the normal trends that we have now expressed by the body of this congress and that is the establishment of the department of homeland security . this in fact takes homeland security responsibilities and actually outsources them . the reason this is so challenging is that the committee on homeland security , the gentleman from california ( chairman cox ) and the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. thompson ) xz4004021 , the ranking member , have not had a chance to review this amendment . this amendment has had no hearings , and here we are talking about giving extraordinary powers to bondsmen . this means if you are an immigrant undocumented in removal proceedings working with a lawyer , working with family members , you are then dispatching bondspersons with no direct immigration training to round you up and immediately bring you to a point of deportation where you are in the middle of a legal process . if that is considered to be , one , a recommendation of the 9/11 commission , i would severely and strongly disagree . yes , individuals who are in line to be deported is an issue . we need more detention beds and more security at our borders , but we do not need to outsource to bondspersons , however financially opportunistic it may be , and as a former judge and someone who deals with these issues in my private practice before coming to congress , i realize bondspersons have their role , but not to contract out to deal with this issue . i know the gentleman from texas ( mr. sessions ) xz4003670 has good intentions , but may i give a historical perspective , and that is of the 1850 fugitive slave act . the truly frightening part of this legislation is it smacks of that kind of effort . the fugitive slave act gave broad , virtually unfettered power to agents or slave owners to seize slaves in the free states and return or send them to slavery in the slave states , obviously with little regard for their legal status in free states with no due process and opportunity to defend themselves . that was 1850 . if we randomly give the opportunity to bondsmen who have no understanding of immigration laws , we can be assured that in a discriminatory fashion they will be rounding up people who look different and speak different languages , and we will be impacted in a very negative way . i close by saying all of us in our congressional districts hear the hardship cases of immigrants who are seeking legal status who have been in line for long times who have had terrible things happen to them because of the complexity of the immigration system . that speaks for comprehensive immigration reform , but those are the very victims , those sad cases , that are going to be impacted by this amendment . i rise in opposition to the amendment that my colleague congressman sessions has offered . this amendment would empower bail bondsman to enforce immigration laws by summarily rounding up and deporting people . it would outsource an important government immigration enforcement responsibility to the bail bonds industry , eliminating the few procedural due process rights immigrants have when challenging deportation . this would be a dramatic change in how we arrest and detain people in removal proceedings . many people rounded up in this manner would turn out not to be deportable after all . they may be u.s. citizens ; they may not be removable under the grounds charged ; or they may be eligible for some form of relief . yet this policy would treat them all as criminals . i am particularly disturbed by the fact that these dramatic policy changes have never been reviewed or examined by a congressional committee . there were no hearings . no debate occurred . no scrutiny at all . in fact , the language of this amendment was only recently made available . without committee scrutiny , we would be giving bonding agents vast , unfettered authority to pursue , apprehend , detain and surrender immigrants -- even when the bond is not breached . this is a certain recipe for misconduct , mistakes and the trampling of civil , due process and human rights . without committee scrutiny , we would be allowing bonding agents to decide when people are flight risks and to round them up and hand them over to dhs for deportation . without committee scrutiny we would be permitting bonds to be forfeited and people deported for not notifying dhs of changes of address prior to a move -- even though dhs regulations give immigrants 10 days after a move to notify the agency of the change . without committee scrutiny , we would be allowing bonding agents to have open access to all information held by the u.s. government or any state or local government that may be helpful in locating or surrendering the person who is the subject of the bond . without committee scrutiny , we would be compelling the disclosure of sensitive or confidential information to a bonding agent , such as : medical history ; criminal investigation notes , location of witnesses , and information on victims of domestic violence . i urge you to vote against this amendment . mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. thompson ) xz4004021 , the newly appointed ranking member of the committee on homeland security . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . let me make a point that i think should be very clear . this legislation will not just impact those who are undocumented . this legislation will impact those immigrants who have legal status . in the process of reviewing or revising that status , they too become part of the large webbed fishnet of hauling people in by people who are inexperienced in this area . so i would offer to my colleagues that this is random , it is reckless , and it needs a bipartisan look and oversight committee assessment . mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . first of all , let me also refer my colleagues to the 9/11 commission report . what it said is that there were certain systems that needed improving or were broken . they suggested no such solution that the gentleman from texas ( mr. sessions ) xz4003670 has offered . we need to strengthen the department of homeland security to be able to do its job , but more importantly , we need to be able to build those detention beds , thousands , if we will , to be able to have those that might be dangerous placed in detention locations . this amendment does not solve that problem at all . the arresting and gathering up of those who might be deported , clearly with no place to go , makes a bigger and worse problem than we might have . i would ask my colleagues to consider this not well directed and ask them to vote `` no. '' mr. chairman , i yield 2 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . ",D
"mr. chairman , clearly this amendment has good intentions , and i think it is important to note that the amendment would require the secretary of homeland security to enter into an aviation security database the name and other information about people who have been convicted of using a false driver 's license for the purpose of boarding an airplane . the objective of this amendment is to enhance our ability to track and detect potential security threats , and as i indicated , i support the objective . i think it is a good idea to require the secretary of the department of homeland security to have information in his database about people who have been convicted of using a false driver 's license . but as they all say , the devil is in the details . again , the same predicament or affliction that impacted the amendment of the gentleman from texas ( mr. sessions ) xz4003670 impacts this . where is the hearing ? where is the oversight ? where is the impact that will occur ? do these also include individuals who mistakenly have such a driver 's license , if that may be the case , and where is the basis for it ? i was just looking at a letter from commissioner hamilton , who talked about controversial provisions that everyone suggests came out of the 9/11 commission , and what he said very carefully was that these are , in fact , recommendations . as the intelligence bill did in the last session with enormous vetting , hearings , oversight , conference committees at the later stage , it almost became a hearing , none of these amendments have been given the kind of vetting that one would know that these are valuable and that the details have been worked out as to how we utilize the database or who gets into the database if , by chance , the utilization was a mistake even though they violated the law . so you create this enormous database that has those who potentially would do us harm , but others , unfortunately , that got themselves into the criminal justice system . we hope , however , that this amendment will send notice to those who might try to use any false document in trying to get on an airplane for the potential damage it may do . mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the amendment that my colleague congressman castle has offered . this amendment would require the secretary of homeland security to enter into an aviation security database the name and other information about people who have been convicted of using a false driver 's license for the purpose of boarding an airplane . the objective of this amendment is to enhance our ability to track and detect potential security threats . i support this objective , and i think it is a good idea to require the secretary of homeland security to have information in his data bases about people who have been convicted of using a false driver 's license . as they say , however , `` the devil is in the details. '' i would like a hearing and a markup on this amendment before deciding whether it should be enacted . i urge you to vote against the castle amendment . mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . mr. chairman , i appreciate the clarification offered by the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 . i would inquire of the author of the amendment , one question : in your research , did we determine that dhs , new as it is , is not doing that ? that is the first question . on the second , let me have the gentleman restate it again . because one of the concerns i have on the select committee on homeland security and watching , for example , tsa formulate itself and work to train certainly very professional employees , but the training does not necessarily lend itself to maybe the keenness of eye to see that false document . we obviously have to improve . i was concerned as to whether or not it is the spotting of someone , saying you have a false driver 's license , or can you restate that it is actually going through a judicial system with a conviction , determining that is what you ultimately did ? ",D
i yield to the gentleman from delaware . ,D
"mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , let me pointedly ask the gentleman , you speak specifically to a judicial conviction going through , as opposed to being tapped and saying , you are carrying a false driver 's license . ",D
the gentleman is talking about actually trial and conviction ? ,D
"mr. chairman , reclaiming my time and i would simply say the comment on this is that i appreciate the distinguished gentleman from delaware being open with his response . one of the concerns i have is that we do not know whether dhs is doing this or what tsa is doing and hearings would have been appropriate . this is a valid issue , let us not doubt that ; and , of course , i would hope that we would want a database to be secured . i do have to raise red flags on making sure it is not random , making sure there is a conviction , and in knowing what happens with dhs . i would have wanted to have hearings , but i thank the gentleman for his answers . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . mr. chairman , let me just close by raising these points . it looks like we are moving quite quickly . it is the question of having the answers . this has good intentions , but the answers of what dhs is doing , the training of tsa , what kind of standards are used in different airports . some tsa person might say it is a mistake , go back . others might make it in essence a federal crime and that person is prosecuted . so some you get in the database , others you do not . it is just a question of concern as to how this will work . again , it is a good idea . before i yield back my time , i would simply say that i would suggest that this amendment be addressed again in our hearings , to be able to detail out what would ultimately happen . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield back my time . ",D
"mr. chairman , i rise in support of the kolbe amendment . i also thank my colleague , the distinguished gentlewoman from california , for yielding me this time and , as well , my colleague and friend , the gentleman from texas ( mr. ortiz ) xz4003020 . let me express my appreciation for his leadership , because we have spent a good amount of time together at the southern border . i have also spent a good deal of time at the northern border , both sides of the coast . clearly , this legislation is needed with respect to improved and increased technology , but i would also argue that the secure our border act , that was offered by the select committee on homeland security democrats in the last congress , really speaks to the broader question . and , frankly , i wish this amendment had gone a step further ; that is that what we do not have are the necessary border patrol agents and their training equal to the enormous responsibility that comes with people coming across the border and , as well , adding that to the technology that is part of this particular amendment . and then , of course , detention beds . the gentleman from texas ( mr. ortiz ) xz4003020 is absolutely right . the southern border now lends itself to the doorway of terrorism because of this concept of otms , and the idea that they are given just a piece of paper , as he said , that says , show up , and no one is required to show up ; or when i say , required , there is no pressure , no enforcement , of their showing up . so technology is certainly what we need , and i hope , as we move forward in the select committee on homeland security , we will , if you will , author bills that will give those resources to the northern and southern border . but we need to understand what the gentleman is saying . this is a crisis as it relates to otms , particularly dealing with the potential of using that border for terrorists to come across . technology is one thing , but human participation is another ; not what has been offered by the president 's budget of 200 border patrol agents , but the 2 , 000 that really will help us secure the borders as necessary . this amendment will go a long way . i rise in support of the kolbe amendment . the kolbe amendment is one of the few ideas that have been proposed on the floor of the house during debate on h.r. 418 that would help secure our borders . we must secure our land borders and putting 21st century technology to work for us is the heart of the solution . homeland security democrats support monitoring our borders 24 hours a day -- 7 days a week . while the kolbe amendment falls short of asking for an interagency border security strategy , as democrats did in the secure border act , it does get at the key issues of assessing technology and staffing . now that congress has passed laws increasing personnel and technology , what we need most is an evaluation of what it will take to secure out borders . additionally , while sensors and cameras are currently being used , simple deployment is n't always the answer . the solution must address the problem and take into consideration the terrain . a ground surveillance program in partnership with the remote aerial surveillance program which was mandated as part of the 9/11 bill will go a long way towards achieving real border security . one missing area element in this amendment seems to be a link between the air and ground surveillance programs . i hope that that 's addressed . we can not afford to build systems in isolation . lastly , while this amendment does add to the debate on border security , these surveillance systems still require border patrol agents to apprehend illegal border crossers and contraband . when homeland security committee staff visited the southern border last year during a six month investigation , they found and heard border patrol agents tell them that they are inadequately staffed to monitor the expansive southern border . one border patrol support staffer explained that staffing shortages meant that he was responsible for simultaneously viewing 26 cameras for illegal crossings and notifying agents when he saw any crossings . this same employee was also responsible for notifying agents about buried sensor activations numbering from 100-150 an hour , and running computer checks on all detainees . it is clear that despite the fact that we have increased border patrol numbers , border patrol still lacks critical support staff . funding border security is a critical component of securing america 's borders . if the president wo n't do it -- let 's make sure that congress does . ",D
"mr. chairman , i thank the distinguished gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 . i thank him for protecting so many of our constitutional rights . mr. chairman , let me say that the asylum laws , as i was reminded by my good and dear colleague from florida , started in world war ii when we were reminded of the ugly scene of turning away the st . louis , the 1 , 000 jews who were fleeing persecution . let me just suggest that we do have an opportunity to review this issue and make it right , but i can tell you that commissioner kean and commissioner hamilton indicated that in advocating that these are recommendations of the 9/11 commission ; these are not recommendations of the 9/11 commission . there is no proof or facts that terrorists have been able to pull one over on us in large numbers . it is very important to let the comptroller general 's study go forward that evaluates the extent to which weaknesses in the united states ' asylum system have been or could be exploited by terrorists . we need to understand this . i do not expect that the report will show that that is happening . it is extremely important that we realize that the 9/11 hijackers entered and remained in the united states as nonimmigrant visitors . they were not individuals who sought asylum . let me correct my good friends about the 1993 bombing . these individuals sought asylum , but they were denied asylum . there is not a crisis here ; but what is a crisis is when you turn people away from our shores who have come here downtrodden , who are seeking asylum because of religious persecution , because of mutilation of women , because of enormous child abuse or potentially child soldiers , and you turn them away because they do not look like you and because , in fact , they can not make their case . i would ask my colleagues to consider opposing this amendment . i rise in support of the amendment that i have offered with my colleagues representatives nadler and meek . it would strike section 101 of h.r. 418 , the real id act , which is entitled , `` preventing terrorists from obtaining relief from removal. '' notwithstanding that title , the provisions in section 101 codify evidentiary standards for asylum proceedings . the supporters of section 101 believe that terrorists are gaming our asylum system to enter and remain in the united states . it is not clear that terrorists actually are gaming our asylum system . section 5403 of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act requires the comptroller general to conduct a study to evaluate the extent to which weaknesses in the united states asylum system have been or could be exploited by terrorists . we need to wait until this study is completed before we rewrite our asylum laws . we can not correct weaknesses that have not been identified yet . i do not expect that report to show that terrorists are gaming our asylum system . the 9/11 hijackers entered and remained in the united states as nonimmigrant visitors . visitors ' visas are easy to get . it only requires a 2-minute interview with an american consulate officer to get a visitor 's visa . the applicant just has to establish that he will return to his country at the end of the authorized period of stay . moreover , it would be naive to think that terrorist organizations do not have ready access to fraudulent entry documents . in contrast , it is difficult and time consuming to enter the united states as an asylum applicant . the terrorist choosing this method would have to present himself at a border and then prove in expedited removal proceedings that he has a credible fear of persecution on account of race , the approach taken by the real id act is to raise the bar on the burden of proof for everyone who applies for asylum , which would result in a denial of relief to bona fide asylum seekers without any assurance that the changes would discourage terrorists from seeking asylum . in fact , terrorist organizations are in a much better position to fabricate evidence of persecution than the typical bona fide asylum applicant who has fled his country in fear for his life without any thought of meeting evidentiary standards at an asylum hearing . for instance , in addition to showing that the alleged persecution would be `` on account of ' one of the enumerated grounds , the applicant would have to establish that the persecution was or will be `` a central reason for persecuting the applicant. '' in effect , the asylum applicant would have to establish what was in the mind of the persecutor . section 101 has a subsection entitled , `` credibility determinations. '' it states that the trier of fact should consider all relevant factors . this is fine , unnecessary but fine . then it provides that the trier of fact has the discretion of basing a credibility determination on any relevant factor , and it specifies relevant factors that can be the sole basis for a credibility determination . near the end it mentions inconsistencies and inaccuracies or falsehoods in statements , `` without regard to whether an inconsistency , inaccuracy , or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant 's claim. '' in other words , it permits an immigration judge to make an adverse credibility finding in asylum proceedings on the basis of an inconsistency , inaccuracy , or falsehood that has no relevance to the asylum applicant 's persecution claim . what has this got to do with preventing terrorists from obtaining relief from removal ? i urge you to vote for this amendment to strike section 101 . ",D
"mr. chairman , i recognize the importance of having standardized drivers ' licenses and identification cards . this should be done on a bipartisan basis , however . the real id act was not bipartisan , and it was moved too quickly through the legislative process . it was passed without any committee hearings or markups .

"mr. chairman , i can not help before i begin to join with my colleague , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. wolf ) xz4004350 , to say that we absolutely can not strike those vital funds for peacekeeping . but , mr. chairman , i rise today , as well as to support those peacekeeping dollars , to say that many of the efforts in this legislation , the work that has been done by the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 and the gentleman from california ( mr. lewis ) xz4002391 , i can appreciate in this emergency supplemental , even though as i have spoken to my good friend and leader , the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr. murtha ) xz4002860 , on this issue , it is important that we have an announced success strategy for leaving iraq . remember what i said , a success strategy , and i have not yet heard that from the administration . but i rise today to comment that the legislation fails to contain important provisions that would provide what is truly needed by our government and that would ensure that the $ 81.3 billion in this bill is really spent wisely . i think we could have done better . i am very disturbed as the ranking member of the committee on the judiciary subcommittee on immigration , border security , and claims that we have now forced into this bill as a self-operating part of the rule that h.r. 418 would be included in the engrossment of the underlying bill , h.r. 1268 . i opposed the republican leadership 's position to attach the real id act to this emergency supplemental . this is anti-immigrant legislation that will not make us safer . rather , it scapegoats asylum seekers and other immigrants . last year , congress passed new driver 's license standards in the 9/11 intelligence reform bill with bipartisan support , and i do support that . it was a good bill , and the intelligence reform bill was supported in a bipartisan manner . but we do not need to undo the careful compromise and thought processes by imposing anti-immigrant policies onto states ' driver 's licenses and identification processes . where is the money ? this is an unfunded mandate . what is a state going to do if they are not able to implement these new procedures because they do not have the money ? the bill is being attached here in an effort to force the senate to pass these ill-conceived policies . we have had no hearings on this real id legislation , and i oppose the inclusion of this bill if the underlying legislation is passed and engrossed as set forth in h. res. 151 . h.r. 418 includes numerous provisions limiting the rights of refugees , imposing onerous new driver 's license requirements on the states , making it easier to deport legal immigrants , legal immigrants , waiving all federal laws concerning the construction of fences and barriers where we have been told by homeland security experts they will not make us safer anywhere in the united states , and denying immigrants long-standing habeas corpus rights . i believe those who are criminals need to be incarcerated , but there are immigrants who are standing in line trying to achieve citizenship . if reenacted into this legislation , it will yet again threaten to close america 's doors to religious minorities escaping religious persecution and women fleeing sex trafficking , rape and forced abortions . in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy , and even after the patriot act , this legislation would further target immigrants for crimes they have not committed and sins for which they are not responsible . at some point we have to treat terrorism as a problem that requires an `` intelligence '' response , as opposed to an excuse to scapegoat immigrants . an emergency supplemental that purports to aid tsunami victims , our troops in iraq and afghanistan is no place for the provisions of the real id act . i support spending the necessary dollars to keep our troops in iraq safe , to provide relief to victims of the tsunami in southeast asia and africa , and to provide security in afghanistan ; but this is a poison pill . i look forward to supporting the jackson amendment . i will offer an amendment to stop the devastating lack of funding on the immigration and customs enforcement section of dhs . but we need to take this real id out of it so we can have a good bill . mr. chairman , i rise in support of some of the efforts funded in this emergency supplemental , h.r. 1268 , although the legislation fails to contain important provisions that would both provide what is truly needed by our government and that would ensure that the $ 81.3 billion proposed in this bill is spent wisely . of particular concern to me as ranking member of the house judiciary subcommittee on immigration , border security , and claims , is the forced inclusion of h.r. 418 in the engrossment of the underlying bill , h.r. 1268 . i oppose the republican leadership 's decision to attach the real id act to this emergency supplemental . this anti-immigrant legislation will not make us safer -- rather , it scapegoats asylum-seekers and other immigrants . last year , congress passed new driver 's license standards in the 9/11 intelligence reform bill with bipartisan support . we do not need to undo that careful compromise by imposing anti-immigrant policies onto states ' driver 's license and identification processes . this bill is being attached here in an effort to force the senate to pass these ill-conceived policies . we have had no hearings on this bill , and i oppose the inclusion of this bill if the underlying legislation is passed and engrossed as set forth in the rule , h. res. 151 . h.r. 418 includes numerous provisions limiting the rights of refugees , imposing onerous new driver 's license requirements on the states , making it easier to deport legal immigrants , waiving all federal laws concerning the construction of fences and barriers anywhere within the united states , and denying immigrants long standing habeas corpus rights . if re-enacted into this legislation it will yet again threaten to close america 's doors to religious minorities escaping religious persecution ; and women fleeing sex trafficking , rape , and forced abortions . in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy , and even after the patriot act , this legislation would further target immigrants for crimes they have not committed and sins for which they are not responsible . at some point , we have to treat terrorism as a problem that requires an `` intelligence '' response , as opposed to an excuse to scapegoat immigrants . an emergency supplemental that purports to aid tsumani victims , our troops in iraq , and afghanistan is no place for the provisions of real id . inclusion in this fashion amounts to a forced acceptance of its provisions much like a contract of adhesion . mr. chairman , i support spending the necessary dollars to keep our troops in iraq safe , to provide relief to victims of the tsunamis in southeast asia and africa , and to provide security for afghanistan . however , the legislation before us today stands to use the public 's fear of terrorism to radically change asylum law for all asylees , not just those with some connection to terrorism or relating to the issues contained in the underlying legislation . for these reasons , i oppose this legislation in its present form . i will , however , support the jackson amendment on africa and i as well , will offer an amendment to stop the devastating lack of funding of the immigration and customs enforcement section of dhs , a real crucial part of the nation 's homeland security . ",D
"mr. chairman , i move to strike the requisite number of words . i want to rise as well to support the gentlewoman from new york 's amendment dealing with the efforts the unfpa is engaged in because we got a chance to see firsthand in visiting sri lanka the work that has been done . it is true that many children were lost . it is true that 15 , 000 , at the time that we were there , women were expecting ; and it is certainly true that they lost a large infrastructure of health care , particularly the women 's hospital that we were able to visit . the women 's maternity hospital was completely destroyed , and so these dollars will be crucial in helping to ensure good health care , good intervention , and safe deliveries . i want to commend all of the leadership that is focused on this particularly narrow issue , though it may seem . it is vital that we provide the support , and i would like to encourage our colleagues to support this amendment . ",D
"mr. chairman , i offer an amendment . ",D
"mr. chairman , let me acknowledge the full committee and the members of the appropriate subcommittee dealing with homeland security and , as well , the full committee chairman 's just recent statement on this issue . but mr. chairman , i would hope that if a point of order is in order , i would hope that that point of order could be waived . and let me share with you why . this amendment is a very narrow amendment , very limited in its request . but it is documented and based upon testimony given by the very principals who are entrusted with the responsibility of homeland security . former outgoing dhs deputy secretary james loy indicated that in testimony to the house appropriations subcommittee on homeland security , that ice , the immigration , customs and enforcement , needed an additional 300 million in order to finish the fiscal year 2004 . this is an emergency . officer callahan came before the judiciary committee just a few days ago on march 10 and indicated that in 5 days we might see the closing of the operations of ice . that is the internal enforcement agency that deals with protecting the homeland internally . now , i have stood on the floor of this house over and over again , and i have said that immigration does not equate to terrorism . there are hard working individuals who are undocumented in this country who clearly have come here for economic reasons . but we also know that coming across the southern border there are what we call otms , other than mexicans , and they come across the border . they are not detained . they are given a document to retain to come back to court for a court date , and they are released on their own recognizance . and do you realize that many of them , some who are coming from countries that have terrorist activities and attitudes toward the united states , and they are able to come up through the southern border , cross into the united states with absolutely no punitive measures whatsoever . why ? because we are shortened at the border and we are shortened in terms of immigration enforcement inside the country , and there are no detention beds . and so i rise today to be able to submit an amendment to ask for $ 40 million , that is all , to be able to carry this entity for a few more days and to be able to respond to the need for more immigration , customs and enforcement officers . immigration enforcement agent randy callahan testified on ice 's financial difficulties , and i realize that there is still a need to be able to fix the financial problems at ice . but fixing the financial problems , which i understand the agency is proceeding under the new secretary of homeland security , does not in any way give reason to deny extra funds for an organization that is entrusted with the security of this nation . we can find common ground on security and immigration . this happens to be one , to provide the resources for this agency in order for it to avoid closing its doors . his description of the problems ice is having financially confirm the concern that i have had for some time . we do not have enough officers . we do not have enough training , and certainly we do not have enough staff in order to do their job . training programs have been postponed . they have halted training for approximately 2000 former detention enforcement officers who are reclassified and combined with the immigration agent position called immigration enforcement agent . do you realize , mr. chairman , that these officers are still carrying the old ids and old id cards and old badges ? why ? because we do not have enough money to give them new badges and new cards . can we not include them in this emergency supplemental ? this is an emergency . you have officers who are carrying incorrect identification and officers who have not been trained who have been transferred into homeland security who are now supposed to be immigration , customs enforcement officers . tragically , one of our officers lost his life in the atlanta courthouse killings , a man who had served for a good number of years . we owe officers who are willing to put their life on the line , no matter what way they have lost it , to be able to provide them with the resources necessary . ice has approximately 900 agents who have not yet been trained . without this training , ice can not use these officers for any type of law enforcement function except transportation officer and possibly some computer work . and as i said to you , they have no badges , and they have no id cards . there is no money for uniforms , so un-uniformed immigration enforcement agents are not able to order replacement uniforms . in fact , the uniforms being used nationwide right now still have immigration naturalization service patches on them despite the fact that the ins no longer exists . lack of funds appears to be causing detention facilities problems in san diego , california and other places . let me just simply say we have the documentation , mr. chairman . i rise to ask my colleagues to support this amendment to ice , and i also will add that i support the palestinian money and the sudan money . but i hope that we will know that we have to secure the homeland by providing extra dollars to respond to the needs of our own staff here in the department of homeland security . mr. chairman , as the ranking member of the subcommittee on immigration , border security , and claims , i have learned of a budget crisis in the homeland security department 's bureau of immigration and customs enforcement , ice . at a hearing last week on interior immigration enforcement resources , immigration enforcement agent randy callahan testified on ice 's financial difficulties . his description of the problems ice is having financially confirms the concern i have had for some time now . for instance , training programs have been postponed . this has halted training for approximately 2 , 000 former detention enforcement officers who were reclassified and combined with immigration agent into a position called , `` immigration enforcement agent , '' iea . ice has approximately 900 agents who have not been trained yet . without this training , ice can not use these officers for any type of law enforcement function , except transportation officer and possibly some computer work . there is no money for uniforms , so uniformed immigration enforcement agents are not able to order replacement uniforms . in fact , the uniforms being used nationwide right now still have immigration and naturalization service , ins , patches on them despite the fact that ins no longer exists . lack of funds appears to be causing a detention facility in san diego , ca , to release detainees from custody . apparently , ice management told its employees that the office had to reduce its adult detentions from several hundred to around 100 . additional funding is needed nationwide to maintain the approximately 17 , 000 detention beds currently in use . ice 's financial problems have resulted in a hiring freeze since last march and severe spending restrictions . in september , ice ordered its offices to refrain from nonessential spending such as travel , temporary duty assignments , equipment and supply purchases , and permanent change-of-station moves . ice is a bureau in financial crisis . they do not have enough money to hold people in custody , buy new uniforms and equipment for employees , or even issue badges and credentials with the correct department on them . emergency funds are essential to correct this problem . former dhs deputy secretary james loy said recently that ice needs $ 280 million to finish out the year . it is not feasible to address that entire need with the emergency supplemental , h.r. 1268 . my amendment , therefore , just seeks $ 40 million , which can be offset in the coast guard allotment . for the reasons stated above , mr. chairman , i ask that my colleagues accept the jackson-lee amendment to fund the immigration and customs enforcement needs . it is a shame that this amendment could not get a waiver of the point of order for the crisis in our department of homeland security . ",D
will the gentleman yield for just a moment ? ,D
"mr. chairman , my understanding of an emergency supplemental is to deal with emergency funding situations in the government . i realize that the present language speaks directly to coast guard , which is part of now the department of homeland security . this amendment amends that section and asks and has a viable offset and asks simply to allow $ 40 million of that amount to be able to be utilized for the underfunded ice agents that do not have uniforms , that do not have badges , that do not have ids . frankly , i believe if we are to do our work in iraq , whether we agree or disagree with the war in iraq , we do know that it is represented to us by the administration to be a war on terror . how can we fight the war on terror in afghanistan and iraq and not fight the war on terror in this country within our boundaries ? the immigration customs and enforcement helps us do that . it separates out those who intend to do us harm from those who are here who may be undocumented but are here simply for economic reasons . we need to be able to thwart those who may come across the border to do us harm and are not caught at the border . we need to be able to have the agency well equipped to protect us by securing those individuals and detaining them . without those resources they can not even continue . do not take my word . take the word of admiral loy , who indicated that they needed more dollars to finish out the fiscal year in question . i would ask my colleague , and i would also ask at this moment , that if he pursues his point of order , whether or not we will have the opportunity , whether in conference or as we continue the appropriations process , to focus on the lack of funding for the immigration and enforcement officers , immigration , customs and enforcement officers , the border patrol , which i think you are aware of , and the detention beds . i would like very much to yield to the chairman , and on this issue i think we are all in common agreement about the need to secure our homeland . ",D
"mr. chairman , i move to strike the last word . i heard my good friend from colorado ( mr. tancredo ) xz4003940 say that this amendment likely will not pass , but i hope maybe the debate will seek and help to convince him of the enormity of the crisis or at least the need in places like sri lanka , indonesia and many other countries that are impacted by the tsunami . if i might draw the gentleman 's memory to the video that showed a single train that had been the lifeline of sri lanka , an opportunity that i took in visiting sri lanka with a number of my colleagues , to see the enormous devastation in terms of the infrastructure of these countries , then the gentleman would realize that in addition to the charitable heart that americans have and the private contributions that have been made , and might i acknowledge the many donations given from the city of houston and the houston tsunami relief effort and the vietnamese relief effort and sri lankans and those from thailand and many , many others in the city of houston and the effort waged by president clinton and president bush , and in my community , jim mackinvale , and many others who worked hard to draw monies out of houston , and i know many other cities and states did the same . but the infrastructure dollars are so very important . so i would hope that my colleagues would oppose this amendment because you can not imagine , i believe , the depth of the amendment and the need to rebuild those countries , and those dollars will help to do so . ",D
"mr. speaker , i rise sadly to oppose the emergency supplemental because of the horrific and ill-advised immigration provisions and the lack of oversight that has been given to the provisions in this section . i hope we will have an opportunity to address this in a comprehensive manner . mr. speaker , i rise today very conflicted over a piece of vital legislation for which this entire body should really be in solidarity . the conference report on h.r. 1268 provides for emergency fy2005 funds for military operations in iraq and afghanistan , tsunami relief efforts , foreign assistance programs and domestic homeland security priorities . however , this legislation also includes an insidious section with provisions of h.r. 418 , the real id act , which has nothing to do with what should be the real intent of this emergency supplemental . instead of being united on issues of national security and international relations , we are put in a divisive situation with the provisions of the real id act . the issues of importance addressed by this emergency supplemental do not give rise to a need to include provisions from h.r. 418 , the real id act -- legislation for which congress has not held a legislative hearing , markup , nor full debate in the house . just last year , our colleagues on the other side of the aisle attempted to force these provisions in the context of the 9/11 intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act , h.r. 10 . the sponsor of the real id act 's driver 's license provisions would have gone far beyond the scope of the 9/11 commission recommendations . the 9/11 commission did not suggest that the standards should be federally mandated without state participation , that a database should be created to share personal identification information , that undocumented immigrants should be prevented from getting licenses or that non-citizens should get an identifiably different driver 's license . finally , none of the real id act sponsor 's provisions have been reviewed by the congress or the commission . there have been no hearings or debates on these significant changes to existing law . the immigration provisions that have been forced into this supplemental include numerous provisions restricting the grant of asylum `` protection , imposing onerous new driver 's license requirements on the states , making it easier to deport legal immigrants , waiving all federal laws concerning the construction of fences and barriers anywhere within the united states , and denying immigrants long-standing habeas corpus rights . the usa patriot act , for which we in the subcommittee on crime , terrorism , and homeland security of the judiciary are only now holding hearings in piecemeal form , already barred terrorists from receiving asylum protection in the united states . none of the people associated with recent attacks , or plans for terrorist attacks in the u.s. , were here under grants of asylum . instead , these changes will make it harder for people legitimately fleeing persecution to prove their asylum claims and gain protection here . bona fide refugees who can not meet the higher standards will be returned to countries where they were persecuted , possibly to face terror , torture and death . the forced provisions will set a dangerous legal precedent by requiring the government to waive all federal , state and local laws to build barriers and fences to deter illegal entry into the united states . this waiver would require violating laws that protect sacred native american burial sites , important environmental regions , and the wages of laborers . yet this policy is unnecessary . in the 9-11 act , we passed language to develop and implement a comprehensive plan for the systematic surveillance of the southwest border by remotely piloted aircraft and other electronic means . we can preserve our legal rights and regimes and still secure our nation . the great majority of this emergency supplemental , a sum of $ 75.9 billion goes towards u.s. military operations in iraq and afghanistan . in this conference report 's military spending total of $ 75.9 billion includes $ 37.1 billion for military operations and maintenance spending , $ 17.4 billion for personnel , and $ 17.4 billion for new weapons procurement . i am very pleased to say that this conference report increases the military death gratuity to $ 100 , 000 , from $ 12 , 420 , and increases subsidized life insurance benefits to $ 400 , 000 , from $ 250 , 000 , for families of soldiers who died or were killed while on active duty beginning from oct . 7 , 2001 . i can not describe how fundamental it is that we take care of our armed forces and their loved ones . this conference report addresses some of the concerns that democrats have had about the fact that the families of soldiers who were killed while on active duty were not being given the necessary funds to provide for themselves . in addition , this conference report provides $ 308 million more than requested for add-on vehicle armor kits ; large increases for new trucks ; added funds for night-vision equipment ; and $ 60 million in unrequested funds for radio jammers to disrupt attempts by iraqi insurgents as i stated there are many provisions of this emergency supplemental in which this body can be united in agreement . one such issue is the tsunami relief provided in this emergency supplemental . the conference report before us today appropriates $ 907 million in direct assistance for tsunami disaster relief for countries affected by the dec . 26 , 2004 , earthquake and tsunami . in addition , this measure also provides $ 226 million to reimburse the u.s. military for expenses incurred in providing emergency relief to the tsunami victims , and $ 25 million to build and deploy 35 new tsunami-detection buoys in the pacific , atlantic , the caribbean and the gulf of mexico to provide warning to communities of approaching tsunamis . i had the opportunity to see the damage caused by the tsunami when i visited sri lanka with my colleagues led by mr. crowley shortly after the tsunami disaster . i had the opportunity to visit with usaid personnel who were there trying to aid the sri lankan people in rebuilding their nation . i have to say the attitude of our american personel and the smiles they brought to the face of the sri lankan people would make every member of this congress very proud . we talk about public diplomacy with the international world and i firmly believe that the funds appropriated here along with the work of our personnel on the ground help make a great case for the goodness of our nation . i am also similarly pleased that about $ 400 million in this conference report will go towards humanitarian assistance in darfur , sudan . i recently had the opportunity to visit refugee camps in neighboring chad where thousands of sudanese in darfur have fled to escape the conflict . needless to say , i was able to confirm from eyewitness accounts that the conflict in darfur is indeed even more shocking and deeply disturbing in its viciousness than has been reported to us . we as a nation must stand against such brutality and the funds in this emergency supplemental will help to ease the suffering of those involved in this conflict . in addition , this conference report includes $ 920 million for all peacekeeping programs , many of which are in sudan . however , while i have always been a strong again , i am in general support of the goals proposed by h.r. 1268 , but i am troubled by the implications of the supplemental appropriations measure that this body is poised to pass that relate to immigration policy . the underlying legislation proposes to fund important needs that pertain to operation iraqi freedom ; operation enduring freedom , in afghanistan ; army and marine corps restructuring ; recapitalization and replacement of equipment ; and replenishment of cash balances in certain working capital funds . in truth , this emergency supplemental funds many needed priorities , but it is the one issue of the real id act , which is not a priority , that poisons this legislation . ",D
"mr. chairman , i move to strike the requisite number of words . i rise in strong support of the tierney amendment , and frankly think it would be irresponsible not to vote for the tierney amendment . all the gentleman is asking for is fiscal accountability on over $ 200 billion that is being spent far beyond these shores . the gentleman is asking for accountability . to not pass the tierney amendment is to be fiscally irresponsible and to continue to be unaccountable to the taxpayers of this country . let me remind members , the amount of money we have now spent in iraq is over $ 200 billion . we do more checking on the books of churches around this country than we do on the expenditure of $ 200 billion . according to a 2003 gao report , `` iraq appears to be the first case where the united states government has used private contractors extensively for protecting persons and property in potentially hostile or hostile situations. '' indeed , it is estimated there are as many as 20 , 000 private military personnel in iraq . what are they all doing ? why are private companies protecting some of the highest level officials we have there rather than our u.s. military ? who is writing those contracts ? what about abu ghraib ? what kind of contract was struck there ? what kind of accountability existed ? well , it did not , why not ? we ought to be investigating as a nation . mr. chairman , what happens with $ 200 billion , our people have a right to know . never have we had a military conflict where so many private contractors are involved . we should be concerned about this and concerned about who is writing these contracts . a recently congressional quarterly article indicated , `` neither the defense department nor private industry says it has exact numbers of how many people are on private payrolls under contracts paid by u.s. tax dollars. '' we should do what is right with the money of the american people . there does not appear to be any legal framework in place to handle and deal with the role of nonmilitary personnel in a war zone . indeed , the liability of contractors who violate the law operating in iraq , afghanistan , and guantanamo bay is ambiguous so we have more responsibility to have strong oversight over these dollars that are being expended . i can not think of a better amendment to pass than this one . federal procurement data suggests that money allocated to military contractors via federal procurement has jumped by more than $ 70 billion in the last 3 fiscal years . someone here should care . we should do what we would do within our own families and look at every single line in these accounts . there is an awful lot of slippage . in january , the special inspector general for the iraqi reconstruction reported that the coalition provisional authority could not account for over $ 8.8 billion . mr. chairman , i want to commend the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. tierney ) xz4004070 for doing what is right , what is fiscally responsible , what provides the accountability that we have responsibility for . i heard another reference on the radio this morning that iraq is going to be a generational commitment like world war ii was . if we are going to spend that kind of money , we ought to make doggone sure that every dollar is properly accounted for . i was pretty upset when i saw big photos of big stacks of money being handed out on the streets over there . i asked one of the top generals the other day if we are paying for the training of the iraqi national guard and these troops that are supposed to replace our troops . he said , no , congresswoman , someone else is paying for that . i am still looking and want to know who is paying for some of these units . i say congratulations to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. tierney ) xz4004070 , who has an uphill struggle here . but he is doing what is right for america in order to make sure that we are responsible to the taxpayer and accountable for every single dollar being expended . please support the tierney amendment .

"mr. chairman , my amendment is offered to force the government of nigeria to transfer the indicted war criminal charles taylor to the united nations special court in sierra leone . mr. taylor xz4003992 is currently residing in calabar , nigeria and maintaining his active role fomenting terror and crime throughout west africa from this base . the united states government has asked that mr. taylor xz4003992 be turned over to the u.n . court , but the government of nigeria has refused . charles taylor has been the leading force for evil in west africa since his overthrow of the doe government in 1990 . hundreds of thousands of liberians were killed during his reign of terror , or forced to flee . mr. taylor xz4003992 enabled liberia to become a base for international organized crime and has subverted the governments of his neighbors . in 2003 , mr. taylor xz4003992 was overthrown by the people of liberia and sought sanctuary in nigeria , despite his indictment by the u.n . special court for sierra leone in the light of his terrorist activities in his own country . the government of nigeria has promised to keep mr. taylor xz4003992 contained , but reliable sources have confirmed political operations in liberia , transfer assets in europe and receive funds from crime in west africa . recently mr. taylor xz4003992 traveled to burkina faso to meet with islamist groups in that country . most disturbing of all , charles taylor organized and paid for an assassination attempt against the president of guinea earlier this year . peace in west africa will not come until charles taylor is brought to justice for his crime and removed as a threat from the region . the nigerian government must be shown that harboring a war criminal and a terrorist is not in their best interest . i urge the house to join me in passing this amendment and standing for justice and the rule of law in west africa . mr. chairman , i yield to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. wolf ) xz4004350 .

"mr. chairman , i rise in favor of the farr amendment . this bill gives the secretary unprecedented authority to waive all laws to finish the construction of the security barrier . this bill denies due process to anyone challenging the secretary 's decision by prohibiting judicial review of the secretary 's waivers . these provisions would undermine the federal trust responsibility to indian nations by allowing waivers of federal requirements of providing tribal notification that are specifically designed to protect native american burial grounds , religious shrines , and cultural and historical sites . i urge my colleagues to support the farr amendment . ",D
"mr. chairman , i rise in reluctant support for the $ 81.1 billion emergency supplemental funding bill we are considering today . the only reason i am voting for the bill before us today is because it provides much needed equipment for our forces in theater , increases death gratuity to $ 100 , 000 for families of soldiers who have died or were killed on active duty . my support for this measure is tepid at best . what troubles me the most about this bill are two key concerns : one , there are no mechanisms for tracking if the money is properly spent . there is simply no mechanism for improving accountability of how taxpayers ' dollars are spent . the defense department wants to take the money and provide little detail to congress on how these dollars are being used or abused . the american people have a right to know how these dollars are spent . and , two , by increasing investments in our war and defense efforts , we further constrain budgetary resources for investments in education , highways , community development , first responders , health care , public health and more . what is at stake here is the very welfare of our states and communities , who find themselves financially strapped because of the economic policies of this administration . our domestic economy can not continue to pursue this trend . despite my many misgivings over this spending bill , i will vote for its passage . we in congress must call on the defense department to provide better accountability for the spending decisions it makes .

"mr. speaker , when h.r. 1268 was first considered on the floor in march , i reluctantly supported its passage . now that the conference report has been returned to the house for this chamber 's approval , i still find myself torn because i do not see how additional funding for the iraq war effort will ultimately produce a positive outcome for the united states or for the people in iraq . i want a successful exit strategy -- not a permanent occupation in iraq . despite my misgivings for the direction of our iraq policy , or lack thereof , i do not believe our troops , who are fighting so bravely , should be penalized for the mistakes in judgment of our civilian military leadership at the white house and the pentagon . as we speak , our ground forces scrounge for scrap metal to make the unarmored vehicles more safe against insurgent attack . the funds provided in this bill will enable our soldiers and marines on the ground to uparmor their vehicles . there should be more outrage from the american public that they were deployed without adequate equipment from the beginning . but they are there . it is vital that our troops receive the equipment they need to defend themselves against attack . i have been critical of our war planning from the outset . i voted against the authority that allowed the president to take action in iraq . i continue to be frustrated that our war plan still contains no game plan on when we can begin to bring our troops home . i am pleased that the bill does contain provisions that require the administration to develop a set of performance indicators and measures for determining the stability and security in iraq and report its findings to congress . this requirement falls well short of the exit strategy we need to determine how long our commitment in iraq will last . the bill also funds tsunami relief , which is well overdue . the agreement appropriates $ 656 million in direct assistance to tsunami disaster relief for countries affected by last december 's tragedy . the total includes $ 5 million to support environmental recovery activities ; $ 10 million to create new economic opportunities for women ; and $ 12.5 million to support initiatives that focus on the immediate and long-term needs of children . the bill provides $ 400 million for humanitarian assistance in the darfur region of sudan and elsewhere in africa , including funds for the temporary resettlement of refugees . it also funds $ 240 million for international humanitarian food assistance through the food for peace program , much of which will go to the darfur region . this assistance will provide some relief to those who are being victimized by the ethnic cleansing that is being waged against the black muslim population by the arab muslim-dominated sudanese government . in a period when the president and this congress proposes reductions in programs that support the development of local communities and neighborhoods , the bill provides $ 592 million for a gold-plated embassy compound in iraq . i find it very difficult to defend such spending when the budget priorities of this administration propose disinvesting in our cities , towns and our american workforce . money for this project goes beyond providing office and working space for u.s. foreign service personnel . what we are proposing to build is not an embassy , but a compound , with stores and other amenities which will further distance our american embassy personnel from the iraqi civilian and political population . we are constructing a fortress , not an embassy . i want a successful exit strategy -- not a permanent occupation in iraq . another key element of this agreement with which i take issue is the mandate imposed on states that requires certain identification standards on driver 's licenses for federal identification purposes . the measure mandates that states meet certain requirements for determining the validity of persons applying for drivers ' licenses . although the bill provides authority for states to receive federal grants to comply , it is insufficient and amounts to an unfunded federal mandate . the money contained in this bill will go a long way to saving lives , saving the lives of our land forces in iraq and afghanistan and reconstructing the lives of those who experienced the devastation of last year 's tsunami . after weighing the alternatives , i reluctantly support the passage of this bill . i am not happy with the choices we are making today . i feel backed into a corner without much wiggle room , but the lives of our troops matter to me and they deserve the protection this bill is designed to deliver to them . ",D
"mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for bringing forth this amendment , with myself and the gentlewoman from north carolina ( mrs. myrick ) xz4002880 . with all due respect to the previous speaker , this is not about debating the merits of the necessity or the needs for a new embassy in baghdad . having traveled to baghdad twice , certainly there is a strong case that can be made that we do need to be moving forth on a new embassy , but this is how we are going to pay for that new embassy , getting back to regular order and procedure around here , and how we are going to afford the cost of this new embassy rather than just going into deficit spending . this amendment speaks to a larger issue . the last time i was in iraq , which was last fall , i noticed one thing , we are dropping a lot of concrete in iraq today , which is an indication that we are going to be there for a very , very long time . and year after year coming forward with more multibillion supplemental spending requests , all deficit financing , is not a sustainable policy . we need to get back to regular procedure and regular order around here , and what better place than to start on a nonemergency creation , the siting of a new embassy to get it to the appropriate committee for proper oversight and hearings of deliberation , and then finding the appropriate offsets to pay for this . i am going to support the supplemental today , as i have past supplementals . i believe our troops need to get all of the tools and resources to do their job safely and effectively . they have been doing a terrific job under very dangerous circumstances , including our state department personnel , who are working in the current embassy within the green zone in baghdad which is also at times a free-fire zone . but at some point we as a chamber and as a body need to get back to the regular process of starting to anticipate these costs , starting to appropriate it and budget for it so we do not leave a huge legacy of debt for future congresses and for our children and grandchildren to inherit . that is what this amendment speaks to . i want to especially commend a couple of units serving us so well from western wisconsin , the 128th infantry guard as well as the 1158th transportation unit . in fact , earlier this morning i got up and ran over to walter reed hospital to visit with some of our troops , including specialist andrew carter from the 128th who almost had his foot blown off due to an rpg that was fired at him during one of his passing patrols . just last week we lost another member from western wisconsin who was shot down in the line of duty , staff sergeant andrew bossert . he will be buried in wisconsin this thursday . i am sure members will join me in sending our thoughts and prayers to his family , his parents , but especially to his wife olya who lives in wisconsin . what we need to start considering at some point is whether or not the ongoing operations in iraq and afghanistan should be paid for as part of the normal budgeting process . these are no longer surprises and no longer emergencies . we know we are there . we know what the mission is going to entail and the costs we are facing . i think this is a good place to start by having this embassy go through the regular process where we can find offsets and an ability to pay for it . ",D
"mr. chairman , i rise today in support of the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense , the global war on terror , and tsunami relief , 2005 . i have had the opportunity to visit iraq twice over the last 2 years and visit with our military women and men and survey the operations of the u.s. reconstruction mission in iraq . never have i been more proud to be an american than when i visited our troops and observed them in the line of duty . my trips reconfirmed that we must give our troops the tools and resources they need to carry out their mission safely and effectively so they can return home soon . for this reason i am supporting the administration 's supplemental request for $ 81 billion . specifically , i would like to highlight the good work of the 128th infantry division out of western wisconsin , and the 1158th transportation company out of tomah , black river falls , and beliot . the 128th is on their first tour of duty in iraq and is performing well , despite several equipment shortages and setbacks the unit has dealt with . the 1158th is on their second tour of duty , and is also performing above and beyond their mission . i am extraordinarily proud of their service to our country . i am especially proud of young men like andrew carter . today i had the opportunity to visit andrew , a member of the 128th , at walter reed hospital . he was recently injured in iraq riding in a humvee that was hit by an rpg . there is a good chance he would have been killed if it had n't been for vehicle armor that was added to the humvee . this supplemental appropriates more funding to continue to armor humvees , so that we can continue to save lives . one of the first things andrew said to me was that he wants to heal quickly so he can get back to iraq and serve with his unit . his resolve is a good reminder of the dedication of our men and women in uniform and why we need to renew our commitment to soldiers like andrew . while i do not endorse all of the supplemental 's provisions , in the absence of a funding alternative , i support the need to provide for our troops . but we do need to start budgeting and paying for their obligations , such as the need for a new embassy in iraq , instead of passing so-called `` emergency '' supplementals and leaving a legacy of debt for our children to inherit . as our military effort continues , i and other members of congress will work to ensure that our service men and women have all the resources necessary to fulfill their mission . again , my thoughts and prayers are with those serving our country , as well as their families . america is firmly behind our troops and we 're all hoping to see them home safe , secure , and soon . may god continue to bless these united states of america . ",D
"mr. chairman , i thank the chairman for yielding me time . i thank the chairman for leading on this most important issue . on september 11 , our nation suffered the most horrible attack ever on american soil at the hands of those with a deep-seated , enduring hatred for freedom . since that day , we have made great strides in improving our nation 's security , but several gaps leave our nation vulnerable to attacks , just like those we suffered that day . the real id bill would close loopholes and make americans more secure . the situation in california where a state environmental commission is blocking a national security barrier from being finished must be remedied . a 3-mile gap remains in a fence which would prevent people from crossing over our southern border in an area that is home to a military base . half a million people are caught there each year trying to get across , and that does not include those who get on through . they are their own environmental problem as well . the real id bill would give the secretary of homeland security the authority he needs to ensure that our national security is not compromised for dubious environmental concerns . our asylum system presently welcomes fraud by those who seek to do our nation harm . the real id bill would allow our immigration judges to use common sense to protect americans while still providing a safe harbor for those who truly need refuge in our country . it is outrageous that we can keep people out of this country based upon terrorist links , but the minute they are in this country , we can not deport them . the real id bill would fix this problem , which poses a great danger to our citizens . perhaps most importantly , our nation 's security will remain at risk so long as we give validity to those who are in our nation illegally in the form of state driver 's licenses and other id 's . driver 's licenses in our country are de facto id cards . they allow people to blend in , move freely , rent apartments , go to work , board airplanes . if states do not require some valid form of u.s. government-issued id to get a driver 's license , any person could walk in off the street and claim to be a legal alien in search of a license , and be granted one . to say that this is not an issue of national security is beyond the limits of reasonability . the real id bill would ensure those to whom we issue government ids and driver 's licenses are in the u.s. legally and make it more likely that those to whom we issue id 's do not intend to harm americans . we must close these loopholes . i thank the chairman and i ask the congress to act . ",R
"i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . mr. speaker , i want to address a number of numbers here . this is a little bit about numbers , and one of them is that 121 organizations that we heard about , as if they were the ones that should obstruct the safety of 282 million americans whose lives are at risk . another number , 19 terrorist hijackers , 19 . nineteen of them with 63 , another number , 63 valid driver 's licenses in their possession . any one of those driver 's licenses got them anything they needed to do in america , full rights of citizenship for that matter , and get on board any airplane . and another number , 3 , 000 dead americans . and what have we done to close the door ? anything ? have we even said `` no '' to the 121 organizations that say , leave the door wide open , keep us at risk because somehow or another there is some kind of tone here that we object to ? we think something is in your heart . we need to close this door . and what have we done ? we have made it harder for terrorists to get on airplanes with razor blades . we spent millions of dollars on metal detectors and millions of dollars expanding tsa and putting federal employees in place , and we put millions of people in long lines waiting to get through . so it is a little harder for them ; they have to stand in line with the rest of us . stand in line with the rest of us where i stand , where i see a 75-year-old lady going through a spread-eagle search while the young middle eastern male waltzes through with a smirk on his face , and we can not close that door . this bill does some of that , not all of that , but it will be the first thing that will keep the 19-type terrorist hijackers off our airplanes , keep them out of our airplanes , out of our automobiles and provide a measure of safety and security for the american people . it is not enough , but it is the barest of common sense , and it must move through this congress , and it must move through this congress right now , today . ",R
"mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the supplemental appropriations bill , and i thank the gentleman from california ( mr. lewis ) xz4002391 for yielding me time . i want to commend the gentleman for putting together what i believe is an excellent bill and for his leadership in reviewing each single element of the administration 's request . the subcommittee on transportation , treasury , and hud that i chair has mostly technical items in this supplemental that are not controversial , so i would like to focus my comments on the overall bill . in the past few months , we have seen an extraordinary progress in iraq and in the middle east at large . from the historic iraqi elections , the new palestinian leadership , voting in saudi arabia , and massive demonstrations in lebanon against their syrian occupiers , i believe that these events show major positive changes that can come to this part of the world . we must maintain that momentum , and that is what this bill does . by passing this legislation , we will keep our soldiers in iraq fully equipped as they continue their daunting task in maintaining security and training iraqis to take over those functions . the funding included in this bill to secure a new united states embassy will help get us out of the palaces that we currently occupy . we will provide much-needed assistance to afghanistan in its efforts to become more secure , restrict the drug trade , and develop its economy . this is a good bill , and it deserves our support . i would like to comment specifically on one part of the supplemental that i know many of us are concerned about , and that is the $ 200 million to aid the palestinian authority . the palestinians have an opportunity to get their house in order , and we should help them . prime minister abbas and finance minister fayyad are the right people for their jobs , but we all know that the palestinian authority still needs a great deal of reform , and we need to be careful about how we provide money to help the palestinians . that is why under the direction and leadership of the gentleman from arizona ( mr. kolbe ) xz4002260 , we included specific conditions for how this money can be used . we maintain the prohibition on direct assistance to the palestinian authority . we require the administration to provide a comprehensive report on the steps taken by the palestinian authority on good governance , economic reforms , and dismantling the terrorist organizations . and we require an audit of the palestinian authority 's financial structures . providing this money sends an important signal that the u.s. is prepared to help the palestinians . including the appropriate conditions sends an equally important signal that the palestinian authority has expectations that must be met . the committee should be commended for handling this issue in a balanced and effective way ; and i urge everyone , obviously , to support it . mr. chairman , again i say , this is a good bill , it is a necessary bill , and i urge again all of my colleagues to support it . ",R
"mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me time . mr. chairman , i rise in support of the passage of h.r. 418 . many of these protections that are contained in this legislation are long overdue . they are necessary to protect our homeland . in particular , i am supportive of the provisions that deal with enhancing our driver 's licenses by providing for some uniformity in the standards used to issue those driver 's licenses and for finishing the border fence in southern california . we ought not to let some vague problem of the environment keep us from finishing this important part of our border security . but that is one step in the process of border security . i am serious about the problem of border security . i represent a district that has more apprehensions of illegal immigrants than any other district on the southern border , in fact , more apprehensions than all the other districts combined . as someone working hard for a long time to help secure our border , i can confidently say the most effective and efficient way to deal with this is to have comprehensive immigration reform . the president of the united states has recognized this . we need to create an avenue for those not crossing for malicious reasons to be funneled through the ports-of-entry along the border . that will allow us to deal with the real problem . mr. chairman , i urge us to support h.r. 418 , and then turn our attention to comprehensive immigration reform legislation . ",R
"mr. chairman , i yield myself of such time as i may consume . mr. chairman , i thank the chairman of the full committee for indulging me with this amendment . this amendment was legislation which was introduced by several of us that represent border districts last year as a freestanding bill . it is now incorporated here in this bill , or parts of it at least are incorporated in this bill . i think it is entirely consistent with the goals of h.r. 418 , because a key component of securing our borders is increasing technology and communication along the border regions . h.r. 418 is a bill about securing our homeland , and this amendment is a perfect complement to the vision of this very important legislation offered by the gentleman from wisconsin . arizona has become a doormat for illegal immigrants . they pour across our porous border every day . in fact , there are more apprehensions of illegal immigrants in arizona than the entire rest of the border combined . many portions of the arizona border are large and unpopulated desolate desert areas . they are hard to patrol and difficult to monitor . in these areas and all along the border it is essential to advance ground technologies in order to officially understand and stop those who come through this back door to our nation . my amendment to h.r. 418 requires the department of homeland security , working through the field offices of the bureau of customs and border protection , to get the technology , the equipment and the personnel needed to address security of our borders . furthermore , the amendment requires that the department of homeland security carry out ground surveillance programs that will improve border security . while the national intelligence reform act of 2004 designed a plan to enhance ground surveillance on the northern border , a similar program was not designed for the southern border . improvements to ground technologies are absolutely essential in the large expanses of desert and unpopulated lands along the southern border . finally , this amendment requires the department of homeland security to improve communications and information sharing with federal , state and tribal government agencies . the various agencies with jurisdiction over the southern border must be able to communicate . this is particularly a problem in arizona , because more than half of the entire border is covered by tribal organizations , tribal units , sovereign tribal nations who are not generally covered by most of the federal legislation we have on telecommunication sharing . having customs agents unable to communicate with border patrol agents or with the policemen from the tohono o'odham nation around the same port of entry is really quite ridiculous . this portion of the amendment addresses problems with the use of incompatible communications technologies and requires that the department of homeland security rectify this situation . the amendment builds on the sentiment , it builds on the intention of h.r. 418 , and through its enhancement of homeland security helps to ensure the safety and defense of our nation . i think it will be a step , perhaps a small step , but one of the very important steps along our southern border to helping improve the technology and our ability to secure that southern border . mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . ",R
"mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 . ",R
"mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . ",R
"mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . i want to congratulate the gentleman on this , his first bill to be brought to the floor of the house of representatives . i think it is indicative of the good work that he and his staff are doing . mr. chairman , i want to talk about the funding of programs that are under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee that i chair , that is , the subcommittee on foreign operations , export financing and related programs . it totals $ 2.7 billion . however , approximately $ 1 billion of that is offset with a cut to previously appropriated funds . the remaining $ 1.75 billion is provided as emergency spending and includes $ 656 million for tsunami recovery . the committee 's overall recommendation for all the programs under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on foreign operations , export financing and related programs is $ 1.2 billion less than the president requested . however , with the $ 1 billion offset , less than half of the president 's request will impact the federal deficit . let me say once again that i do strongly support the objectives that the president seeks to achieve with this request as it relates to afghanistan , the middle east , the ukraine and the tsunami-devastated areas of asia . but i did tell chairman lewis that i would scrutinize this request , and the result of that scrutiny is what is before the members today . we have assigned the highest priority to programs that can be implemented and executed during 2005 and that are not likely to be funded by other donors . the resulting recommendation is a balanced approach to supporting the president 's request and provides much-needed emergency appropriations to further the fight against terror and provide disaster assistance . let me explain further the recommendation for the programs under the foreign operations jurisdiction . we broke the president 's request down into three different categories . the first includes programs that are true emergencies , such as replenishment of funds that were reprogrammed previously for tsunami disaster assistance and poppy eradication in afghanistan , funds for the humanitarian crisis in darfur and in asia , and funds to train afghan police , funds that are necessary to improve conditions that would enable us to bring our troops home as soon as possible . total emergency spending under this first category is $ 1.75 billion , as i already indicated . the second category of funds includes those programs requested by the president that we have determined to not be an emergency , but are important to u.s. leadership abroad . additionally , this category includes reconstruction resources to stabilize and improve conditions in afghanistan and the middle east which support our efforts to bring our troops home , funds to support the democratic movement and government in ukraine , and funds for programs in the west bank and gaza . we have provided $ 995 million in this second category of nonemergency spending and have offset these funds with the rescission of prior foreign assistance appropriations , specifically funds that were appropriated for turkey in the fiscal year 2003 supplemental bill . i think my colleagues recognize that we are faced with unique opportunities in the middle east and afghanistan . our leadership can have positive influence in both the west bank and gaza , in ukraine , in indonesia and sri lanka and , of course , in afghanistan . i saw a press report recently from indonesia , the world 's most populous muslim country , that showed that the backing for osama bin laden had dropped from 58 percent in 2003 to 23 percent today . i believe part of that is due to the efficiency and the generosity of u.s. relief efforts after the december tsunami . as chairman of the foreign operations , export financing and related programs subcommittee , i am repeatedly reminded of how much we as a nation do each year to provide disaster assistance and relief . it is encouraging to know that at least one important muslim country has started to take notice . finally , the last category includes programs requested by the administration that we determined were less urgent and could be considered in the 2006 budget process . this category totals $ 1.2 billion in funding and includes fiscal year 2006 operating costs of our programs overseas and large construction projects that can either wait for consideration or would have a possible revenue stream , making them ideal projects for world bank and asian development bank funding . these programs total $ 616 million for afghanistan , $ 200 million for the new global war on terror partners fund , the new $ 200 million solidarity fund , and $ 45 million in debt relief for countries affected by the december tsunami . let me say that the funds we are providing in the foreign assistance chapter must be considered an investment in security both in the region and on american soil . it is also a responsibility to our future . we must not be faced 20 years in the future with the knowledge that we looked at the opportunities of a taliban-free afghan government , a democracy-oriented government in the ukraine , a middle east craving freedom and representative government , only to turn away and leave them to their own meager means with no u.s. influence . mr. chairman , i urge that this legislation be adopted . i believe that this is a good bill and a well written one . ",R
"mr. chairman , i just want to clarify one point the gentleman from massachusetts made about the $ 8.8 billion , and i just think we members need to understand we are talking about funds that came not from the united states taxpayers , but those $ 8.8 billion are funds from the iraqi fund , which was iraqi dinars that had been collected as a result of oil sales . it was a chaotic situation at the end of the war , as we all know , and ministries had collapsed . there was no communication . there were no accounting systems . the bureaucrats had not functioned for years . it was very difficult , at the very best , to know how to handle those in the very best way . it was really a choice of whether or not we were going to get the projects done as quickly as possible and get the country functioning again . so i think , to me , the choice was fairly clear . i just want to make people understand we are not talking about u.s. dollars when we talk about the 8.8 . ",R
"mr. chairman , i move to strike the last word . as the gentleman from illinois ( mr. jackson ) xz4001980 knows , i spoke in committee against this amendment which was then part of a larger amendment and these two were combined at that point . i made the point that i was not at all sure that this additional money was needed in darfur , sudan in light of the amount of money that is already in the 2005 bill and the amount of money that is in the supplemental for this region . however , i understand the gentleman from illinois ( mr. jackson ) xz4001980 feels very strongly about this . he and i traveled together to the darfur region . we saw the terrible , terrible suffering that the people there are going through . we are in complete agreement on our need to take every step that we can to provide not only for a peaceful solution in the area , but also to provide for humanitarian relief for the people who live in that region , and therefore i am prepared today with concurrence of the chairman of the committee to accept this en bloc amendment , and we will take a very good look at this in the conference with the senate and see where we are at that point . we will be a little bit further down the road and have some time to get a better handle on this at that point . i again want to commend the gentleman for his commitment , his dedication , his passion in offering this amendment today . ",R
"mr. chairman , can the gentlewoman clarify which amendment we are talking about here ? ",R
"mr. chairman , i think i heard the reading of two amendments . which one are we on here at this point ? are we on the one that is $ 3 million or the one that was the larger one that i heard read first ? ",R
is that the one we are considering ? is that the understanding of the chair ? ,R
"mr. chairman , i am now clear which amendment we are talking about . i appreciate the gentlewoman yielding for that purpose . ",R
"mr. chairman , i have looked at the amendment , and i understand what the gentlewoman is talking about , what her intentions or how it would be used in the tsunami recovery fund . it does not , of course , specifically provide for that , and i am prepared to accept this amendment if the gentlewoman would be willing to move the discussion along as quickly as possible . ",R
"mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the amendment . mr. chairman , i strongly oppose this amendment . i think most of my colleagues know that there were at least 225 , 000 , maybe many more than that , people who were killed in the countries affected by the december 2004 tsunami , most particularly indonesia , sri lanka , india and other countries as well . there were 1.1 million displaced persons , 1.1 million displaced persons . this is a disaster and it is an emergency . the president has outlined a recovery plan . this amendment , although it does not strike the dollars , makes funding ineligible to be spent for these purposes . some of these funds would go to reimburse accounts already depleted , usaid accounts , emergency disaster relief accounts , that have been previously spent . so it is very important that we retain those accounts and that we retain the money for those . the rest of the funds are for a reconstruction plan that has been i think fairly well thought out . it is not , i do not think , extraordinary given the size of the catastrophe that we have experienced , $ 340 million to rebuild infrastructure , roads , ports , bridges , water treatment plants and a signature project which would be the construction of a 250 kilometer stretch of road from the capital , banda aceh , at the north end of sumatra down the west coast to meulaboh in indonesia . this road is the only link that these little communities that are utterly devastated and destroyed by the tsunami -- this road is the only link that these communities will have with the outside world . these reconstruction projects needs to get under way immediately . until that happens , the only contact , the only way to get relief supplies to these little valleys which on the back side has a very high ridge of mountains and no access by road , the only way to get supplies to them is by air or by sea , a very expensive project . the road needs to be constructed . i think it is an emergency and i believe most of my colleagues would agree with that . the u.s. has had a history of responding in a very compassionate way to disasters wherever they occur , here in the united states and also abroad , and i believe that this compassion is something that marks americans and makes us who we are . and i would certainly hope that my colleagues would agree that these funds are a relatively small amount of money , given the total level of devastation of the disaster there , a relatively small amount of money to help this area recover and to replenish the money that was already spent in relief . mr. chairman , i would urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment .

"mr. chairman , i reserve a point of order on the gentleman 's amendment , and since the gentleman from texas has already spoken , i do not know whether he intends to speak again before i make the point of order or whether he is prepared to go forward at this time . ",R
"yes , mr. chairman . i make the point of order , as the chairman of the full committee has said on several occasions . i am more than sympathetic . he is more than sympathetic to some of these amendments . i especially feel that way with this amendment , given the fact that it deals with something that is very dear to me , the issue of border security . however , i would make a point of order against the amendment which is not the humdrum of little technicalities . this is the rules of the house . it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and , therefore , violates clause 2 of rule xxi . the rule states in pertinent part that an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if in changing existing law it gives affirmative direction in effect . this amendment would do that , and i ask for a ruling from the chair . ",R
"mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent that debate on this amendment , and any amendments thereto , be limited to 10 minutes , to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself , the opponent . ",R
"if the gentleman will yield , of his 5 minutes , that is correct . ",R
"that is correct . when you make the unanimous consent request , it is all amendments to this amendment . ",R
"mr. chairman , i yield myself 3 minutes . mr. chairman , i really do not understand the need for this amendment that is offered by the gentleman from new york . surely as he knows , there are not any funds in this bill for saudi arabia in the foreign operations chapter . additionally , there are reporting requirements to ensure that the funds are spent exactly as the committee intends . we do not intend that any of the funds should go to saudi arabia . so the gentleman from new york is incorrect when he says this is similar to the legislation that was passed last year on the regular appropriation bill . there was some money in last year 's bill that went to saudi arabia . this bill does not have any money for saudi arabia , so it is completely unnecessary . it is a gratuitous kind of amendment . it i would also point out , as i just mentioned , that we included the prohibition in the 2005 regular appropriation bill . section 575 of public law 108-447 states : `` none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to that act shall be obligated or expended to finance any assistance to saudi arabia. '' the prohibition that is in that legislation extends to the fiscal year 2005 supplemental bills . supplemental legislation includes appropriations that are added on top of the regular appropriations . so the underlying prohibition also applies here . there are no funds in this bill that could be used for saudi arabia . this is simply repeating something that has already been added into the regular legislation . the gentleman from new york is simply wrong when he says that the president could come and reprogram funds for saudi arabia . the underlying prohibition would prohibit that . the administration can reprogram funds , but they can not reprogram them to spend them in saudi arabia . the gentleman is simply wrong about that . i am sure the gentleman is aware of these facts and i am sure he is aware , as he has pointed out , of how helpful saudi arabia has been very recently in helping to defuse the situation in lebanon , the very direct statements that were made to president assad about how his troops should depart from lebanon . if the gentleman wants to make his statement , fine , i would encourage him to do so ; but the appropriation bills include the substance of what is in his amendment ; and since there is no money in this bill for saudi arabia , this amendment is not only redundant , it is unnecessary , it is a slap in the face , it is just simply absolutely wrong for us to do this . i strongly urge the defeat of this amendment . mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . ",R
"mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . i will not even take all that time . i simply want to repeat the arguments against this amendment . there are no funds in this bill that go to saudi arabia . there is a prohibition in the fiscal year 2005 foreign operations bill that prohibits any funds from going to saudi arabia , and that prohibition applies to this bill . this amendment is totally unnecessary . this amendment has absolutely no bearing . it is simply repeating what is already in the existing law that applies to this bill . to add another prohibition here now is simply to add insult to injury . it is gratuitous . it has absolutely no reason to be in this bill , and i would urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment . mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . ",R
"mr. chairman , i appreciate the gentleman raising this point , and i want to make it very clear that religious organizations may compete on an equal footing for usaid funding in this bill , as they may for usaid funding in other bills . so the answer to the gentleman 's question is yes . ",R
"mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the amendment . the gentlewoman has raised some very important points , and i know she has done a great deal of work in this area as it relates to charles taylor and west africa . there is no question it is a very troubled area , and charles taylor has certainly contributed to the instability in the region . there are no funds in the legislation that deal with nigeria , and there are a lot of circumstances around this issue that i think are difficult in the sense that the united states has played a role in all of this as to where he is at the moment . we do want this person brought to justice , and i know that is the intention of the united states . i would hope , however , that the gentlewoman would withdraw this amendment because i believe that would be in the best interest of united states foreign policy . we will certainly work with the gentlewoman and her staff to try to resolve the situation , and work with the state department and the gentlewoman to get a satisfactory explanation of what is being done . ",R
"mr. speaker , first of all , i want to congratulate the chairman of the full committee on this , his maiden effort , to bring a major supplemental appropriation to the floor as chairman , and i congratulate him for the leadership that he has shown in bringing this so swiftly to this floor . i do rise in support of the conference report to h.r. 1268 . before i address the funding that is the responsibility of my subcommittee , i want to briefly acknowledge a critically important part of this bill , border security funding . the securing of our nation 's borders to prevent the hemorrhaging flow of illegal immigration through my state of arizona has got to be a top priority for the federal government . the people i represent living on the border are frustrated with the illegal immigration system , and we must address gaps in border security now . arizona and other border states can no longer serve as the back door for this country 's broken immigration system . by adding the funding that we do in this bill , we are taking a step in the right direction to ensure our northern and southern borders are protected . regarding the foreign operations , export financing , and related programs subcommittee chapter of this legislation , the conference report includes $ 2.53 billion in funding for programs under the jurisdiction of the foreign operations , export financing , and related programs subcommittee , which i chair . while this overall level is $ 1.4 billion less than requested , let me say once again i strongly support the objectives of the president that he seeks to achieve with this request for afghanistan , the middle east , and the tsunami-devastated areas of asia . i believe that this conference agreement provides the financial support necessary to help the united states achieve these objectives . the major elements of the conference agreement that differ from the house-passed levels are additional funds for afghanistan reconstruction , the solidarity initiative , and support for ukraine . the $ 739 million proposed by the house for afghanistan reconstruction represented the highest priority projects that could be implemented and executed during 2005 . the senate provided $ 1.3 billion , the administration 's request . and the conference level is $ 1.086 billion , or $ 347 million over what the house had recommended . this increase over the house level supports some 2006 requirements , which is , i believe , a cost-effective approach to the 2006 budget process . the house provided no funding for the administration 's $ 400 million solidarity initiative . the senate provide a total of $ 225.5 million , $ 200 million in the solidarity fund and $ 25.5 million in the global war on terror partners fund . the conference agreement provides a total of $ 230 million , merging the two funds into one appropriation , and places these funds within peacekeeping operations appropriations . this arrangement provides for regular order congressional review of the department 's plans for these funds . the conference agreement provides $ 60 million for ukraine , and these funds will support the government of ukraine 's highest priorities for political and economic reform , including anti-corruption initiatives and support for the upcoming parliamentary elections . i think my colleagues recognize that we are faced with unique opportunities in the middle east and afghanistan . this agreement will provide the financial resources necessary to promote democracy and provide the state department with programs and projects to support these positive influences . let me say that the funds we are providing in the foreign assistance chapter must be considered an investment in security both in the region and on american soil . however , congress has the responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars are used efficiently and transparently , and we take that responsibility seriously with reporting requirements , and we will continue vigorous oversight of these programs . the greatest weight all of us must bear is the knowledge that these decisions we make directly put the lives of americans at risk . i firmly believe the bill before us today will help build stability and freedom in afghanistan , the middle east , and parts of asia . i urge my colleagues to vote `` yes '' on the fiscal year 2005 emergency supplemental conference report on h.r. 1268 . i rise in support of the conference report to h.r. 1268 , a bill making emergency supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2005 . before i address the funding in my subcommittee , i wanted to briefly acknowledge a critically important part of this bill -- border security funding . the securing of our nation 's borders to prevent the hemorrhaging flow of illegal immigration through my state of arizona must be a top priority for the federal government . the people i represent living on the border are frustrated with the illegal immigration system , and we must address gaps in border security now . arizona and other border states can no longer serve as the backdoor for this country 's broken immigration system . by adding this funding we are taking a step in the right direction to ensure our northern and southern borders are protected . i am pleased that my colleagues on the conference committee agreed to provide $ 635 million for border security to hire an additional 500 border patrol agents , 50 additional criminal investigators , 168 immigration enforcement agents and deportation officers , and to fund 1 , 950 additional detention beds . the bill also includes my amendment to strengthen the real id act to address the technology , equipment , and personnel needs improving security within the u.s. , requiring department of homeland security to carry out an improved ground surveillance program , and requiring dhs to improve interagency communication . regarding the foreign operations subcommittee chapter , the conference agreement includes $ 2.532 billion , in funding for programs under the jurisdiction of the foreign operations subcommittee of which i am chairman . this amount is $ 685 million over the house level , $ 251 million less than the senate level , and $ 1.4 billion less than the administration 's request . while this overall level is $ 1.4 billion less than requested , let me say once again that i strongly support the objectives the president seeks to achieve with this request for afghanistan , the middle east , and the tsunami devastated areas of asia . i believe that , with the understanding that we need to reduce our federal deficit , this conference agreement provides the financial support necessary to help the united states achieve these objectives . the major elements of the conference agreement that differ from the house passed-level are : additional funds for afghanistan reconstruction , the solidarity initiative , and support for ukraine . the $ 739 million proposed by the house for afghanistan reconstruction , represented the highest priority projects that could be implemented and executed during 2005 . the senate provided $ 1.3 billion , the administration 's request . the conference level is $ 1.086 billion , $ 347 million over the house recommendation . the increase over the house level supports some 2006 requirements -- a cost effective approach to the 2006 budget process -- such as $ 101.4 million for two additional power plants , $ 8.4 million for a water pipeline , $ 72 million for additional roads and infrastructure , and $ 43 million for economic governance . the house provided no funding for the administration 's $ 400 million `` solidarity initiative. '' the solidarity initiative request of $ 400 million for two $ 200 million funds to be used by the secretary of state , as she determines , was to offset the costs of those countries that have dedicated troops to the global war on terror as well as economic support to other nations that have provided support . the senate provided a total of $ 225.5 million -- $ 200 million in the solidarity fund and $ 25.5 million in the global war on terror partners fund . the conference agreement provides a total of $ 230 million , merging the two funds into one appropriation and places these funds within the peacekeeping operations appropriations . this arrangement provides for regular order congressional review of the department 's plans for these funds . this will provide sufficient oversight of a substantial amount of money for the global war on terror . the house provided $ 33.7 million for support to ukraine . the senate provided the administration 's request of $ 60 million . the conference agreement provides $ 60 million for ukraine . these funds will support the government of ukraine 's highest priorities for political and economic reform , including anti-corruption initiatives and support for the upcoming parliamentary elections . i think my colleagues recognize that we are faced with unique opportunities in the middle east and afghanistan . u.s. leadership can have positive , democratic influence in the west bank , gaza , lebanon , belarus , and ukraine . this agreement will provide the financial resources necessary to promote democracy and provide state department with programs and projects to support these positive influences . finally , the conference agreement provides $ 656 million for assistance to the victims of the tsunami and earthquakes of last december and march . let me say that the funds we are providing in the foreign assistance chapter must be considered an investment in security both in the region and on american soil . however , congress has a responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars are used efficiently and transparently , and i know my colleagues take that responsibility seriously . we have included financial reporting requirements for all funds in the foreign operations chapter . for afghanistan counternarcotics and west bank gaza programs , we have included additional auditing requirements . as chairman , i pledge to continue vigorous oversight of these programs . the greatest weight all of us must bear is the knowledge that decisions we make as members of congress directly puts the lives of americans at risk . already , men and women from probably every district represented today have made the ultimate sacrifice in iraq and afghanistan . i firmly believe the bill before us today will help to build stability and freedom in afghanistan , the middle east and parts of asia . again , i urge my colleagues to vote `` yes '' on passage of the fiscal year 2005 emergency supplemental conference report on h.r. 1268 . ",R
"mr. chairman , i just want to say i think this is about as dumb a thing as we can do . i think to take the money away from people who are doing the hard work , these are our people . these are people that are there because they care about our country and they care about freedom and they care about bringing hope and opportunity to the people of iraq . and the idea that we do not want to provide safe haven to them and the idea that we want to micromanage where this place is going to be is nonsense . we can not do that . we are asking people to go over there and bring hope and freedom and opportunity . these are americans . these are people that we sent there . and so we are saying to them that we do not want to give them safe haven ; we do not want to give them an opportunity to have a safe place to live and do their work , the work that we have asked them to do ? we need an embassy there . i can not think of a dumber thing that we could do as to take this money away and to try and micromanage the way that we are going to establish an embassy and an opportunity for people to live safely over there . those of you that have been there know what a dangerous place it is . these are the people that are doing the hard work . i would urge every member to vote against this amendment and to send a message to the americans that are over there , the people that are doing the hard work to bring democracy , we care about their safety , we care about the work they are doing . vote against the upton amendment and say to our friends over there , we care about your safety , we care about what you are doing , and we thank you for the tough , tough job you are doing in an area that is probably as dangerous as anywhere in the world . vote against the upton amendment . ",R
"mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 1268 . i would like to thank the committee leadership for their efforts to provide our men and women in uniform with the equipment that they need to succeed . as a member of the house armed services committee , i have worked with my colleagues to provide much-needed force protection equipment to our troops . h.r. 1268 includes $ 75 million for body armor , $ 51 million for up-armored humvees , and $ 611 million for add-on armor kits for vehicles . having visited our wounded soldiers at walter reed army medical center , i know that we can prevent further injuries by funding this important equipment , and i appreciate the committee 's efforts in this area . furthermore , the bill raises the military death gratuity from $ 12 , 000 to $ 100 , 000 and increases subsidized life insurance benefits from $ 250 , 000 to $ 400 , 000 for families of service members who died or were killed on active duty , retroactive to october 7 , 2001 . as a cosponsor of legislation to increase the military death gratuity , i believe we must appropriately honor those that have made the ultimate sacrifice , and these benefit increases are one small gesture that congress can make to demonstrate our respect . this legislation also demonstrates our nation 's commitment to aiding those in dire need throughout the world . h.r. 1268 includes $ 656 million for disaster relief to the victims of the tsunami as well as essential peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance to darfur . however , i was deeply disappointed that the house leadership used a procedural move to attach the language of the real id act , which i opposed when the house considered it in february . the real id act would significantly alter our nation 's asylum and immigration laws in the name of homeland security , though its provisions went far beyond the recommendations of the 9/11 commission . the senate has already registered some opposition to the real id provisions , and i fear that their inclusion in the house 's supplemental bill will slow down the process and prevent us from sending assistance to those who need it most . our primary responsibility should be to assist our men and women in uniform and to fulfill our promises to the nations that were devastated in the december tsunami . i urge my colleagues to move swiftly to pass this measure and to drop any extraneous provisions that would hinder this important funding .

"mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the gentlewoman 's amendment . it is long overdue that action be taken on this criminal and mass murderer , and i hope all of my colleagues will vote for this amendment . ",D
"mr. chairman , i move to strike the requisite number of words . out of deference to the chairman , i will be very brief , but i want to thank the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. tierney ) xz4004070 for raising this at this time ; and he has done a wonderful job in leading this effort . i would just like to stress the dual dimension of bipartisanship of this amendment . one , its legislative approach was introduced in the last congress , and with the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. tierney ) xz4004070 i reintroduced it in this congress . secondly , as we think back to the truman commission , which the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. tierney ) xz4004070 referenced , it is very impressive that that commission was established by the party in power at the time , and so it was the party in power that wanted to look at itself . thirdly , the truman commission was established at a time that senator truman was very concerned that a very small number of contracts were let to a very small number of companies in a very narrow part of the country . at the time , he was concerned about american manufacturing being held by too few in a contract sense . now we are looking at services where it looks like a very small number of companies have gotten very large contracts . it is more complicated today because , in addition , some contracts are going to foreign firms . so this is a very delicate area . i personally believe that the only way you can maintain a support for national policy , however controversial , is to have complete confidence that things are being pursued in the most honest way possible . i think the time has come for this type of approach . i would hope this congress would look at it . ",R
"mr. chairman , i thank the chairman . ",R
"mr. chairman , i move to strike the last word . mr. chairman , as the daughter of a veteran , 25 years in the army , i want to express my profound respect and appreciation for our brave men and women serving on the ground in iraq . they have a very difficult job , and all of us pray for their safe return , and many of us want them home very quickly . the administration 's request for an additional $ 82 billion brings the total war funding to nearly $ 300 billion . we must continue to ask just where has this money gone ? for example , the coalition provisional authority was unable to account for about $ 9 billion , and that is just what we know . where did that money go ? we deserve to know . the american people deserve to know what our tax dollars have paid for . did that $ 9 billion go , for example , to protect our troops ? we have no idea . another important question is , are we safer today than when this war began ? the answer is plainly no . if one believed the administration , the goal of the war was to prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of terrorists and that iraq posed an immediate threat to the united states . now it appears that this unnecessary war may have actually increased that threat . instead of stopping terrorism , this administration 's policies have allowed it to expand . according to the national intelligence council , this administration 's war has turned iraq into a breeding ground for islamic terrorists . before the war on iraq , there was no connection , no connection , between saddam hussein and al qaeda . now there is . congress requires the administration to give a thorough accounting of how our tax dollars have been spent pursuing these policies in iraq and what the administration 's expectations are for future expenses . and despite this law , the administration has flatly refused to make this accounting to us , to the american people , or to determine what the future costs will be . we know , however , what has been overlooked . there is a documented failure to provide our troops with both body armor and armored vehicles . there are documented cases of waste and fraud perpetrated by contractors like halliburton . mr. chairman , it is the height of hypocrisy for members of congress to say that they support our troops and then fail to insist on the accountability of how these funds are being spent and whether or not the previous resources allocated were spent to protect our troops . if one asks me , the bush administration just wants another blank check . no oversight , no accountability , and they have failed to provide a concrete plan for how our troops will stabilize the situation in iraq and to bring our troops home . mr. chairman , this administration has much to account for . there have been too many blank checks and not enough accountability . i will vote against the supplemental and urge my colleagues to do the same . ",D
"mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . mr. chairman , it is with great pride that i bring before the house h.r. 1268 , a bill making emergency supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2005 . this is my first appropriations measure as the new appropriations committee chairman . i am especially proud of the extraordinary effort put forth by the committee 's members and staff to report a bill that will better permit our troops to prosecute the war on terrorism and will do so with a price tag less than that requested by the president . mr. chairman , i would like to have the house pay special attention to three of my colleagues who have come back from the private sector to help serve this committee . frank cushing is my staff director , and david lesstrang and jeff shockey are my deputy staff directors for the committee . i really appreciate their willingness to make great sacrifice to come back . six of the committee 's 10 subcommittees participated in the development of this measure which provides $ 81.27 billion in urgent and emergency spending . the lion 's share of that amount , some $ 76.8 billion , is for defense-related expenditures . this funding represents an increase for defense needs of $ 1.8 billion above the president 's request , which i hasten to note is entirely for enhanced support for deployed , soon-to-be deployed , or returning troops in order to assist in force protection and to increase the survivability of the troops in the field . to provide these important resources for our troops , we reduced other , nonessential dod requests by some $ 600 million as well as nearly $ 1 billion in foreign assistance-related programs that were either not well justified or did not meet the strict definition we applied for emergency spending . in addition , another $ 1 billion of extremely important and time-sensitive non-emergency foreign assistance approved by the committee was completely offset by a rescission of funds originally appropriated in fiscal year 2003 . with my colleagues ' indulgence , i would like to take a few moments to give the house a flavor of the urgent procurement needs that the committee has included in the measure for our troops . those include up-armored humvees and other new humvees , medium and heavy trucks , night vision devices , handheld stand-off mine detection systems , jammers , improved high-frequency radios , strykers to replace combat losses , add-on armor kits , small-arms modifications and ammunition , body armor for both the army and marine corps , and medical supplies . in addition to our providing these necessary resources for our troops , the committee was compelled to fully fund the army 's modularity program at this time because of the urgency to address the significant challenges the army now faces in mitigating stress on the current active duty combat force . to meet this problem , the army will not only create 10 additional combat brigades ; all of the current combat brigades will be redesigned to enhance their ability to deploy more rapidly and operate more independently on the battlefield . i might add that our determination to procure additional equipment beyond the president 's request will allow forthcoming troop rotations to receive much of their equipment prior to deployment , clearly an obvious benefit to the success of our troops . beyond the requirements of our defense community , the bill provides $ 656 million to meet the human needs resulting from last december 's horrific tsunami . in addition , the bill includes $ 592 million for the construction of the u.s. embassy compound in baghdad . while that money for the embassy is a reduction of some $ 66 million , or 10 percent , from the president 's request , construction of the embassy compound has been deemed urgent because of the imminent security threats to some 4 , 000 u.s. personnel in iraq . thus far , 45 personnel with the u.s. mission in iraq have been killed , including two american citizens who were killed by a rocket attack on our diplomatic compound the day of the iraqi elections . providing the funds now will greatly reduce the amount of time our personnel remain in harm 's way . despite the additional needs we have recommended on behalf of our troops , the committee 's bill is $ 614 million less than that requested by the president . this reduction comes largely as a result of reductions in proposed foreign assistance spending . mr. chairman , i believe this measure is responsible both in how we have responded to the needs to provide for adequate resources in making this fight against terrorism and also in how we have carefully scrubbed each and every program so that we can say with utmost assurance that this is a fiscally sound piece of legislation . mr. chairman , as i close my remarks , i wish to express my deep appreciation for my ranking member from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 , as well as to each and every member of the committee . i have already expressed my feelings about our staff on both sides of the aisle . all of them have worked so diligently to prepare effectively this legislation . mr. chairman , as i mentioned at the outset , i am very proud of this measure i bring to you , my first measure as chairman of the committee on appropriations . i certainly urge the members to adopt this bill . mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
